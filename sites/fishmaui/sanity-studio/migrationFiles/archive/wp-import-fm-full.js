				"<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-660\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sea-sickness-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"sea-sickness\" width=\"253\" height=\"168\" />Some people, no matter what they try, always succumb seasickness. If you think this might be you, I'd suggest you either book a private fishing charter so you can request the trip be ended early (do not expect a refund), or remain on dry land.\n\nMany people opt for a Maui bottom fishing charter instead of sport fishing because they're concerned about seasickness. While a shorter day on the water might be wise if you're new to fishing, being nearer to shore does <em>not<\/em> mean you won't feel the rock and roll of the ocean. In fact, when the engine is off or idling, the swells can feel even be more pronounced than they are when the vessel is underway.\n\nThere are also some sport fishing charters – specifically those that leave before dawn and remain out for 8+ hours – where seasickness is more common. We recommend <em>all<\/em> passengers on these trips take preventative measures.\n\n<strong>There are a number of things you can do to minimize/avoid sea sickness on your Maui fishing charter. Here is a brief list of some of them.<\/strong><strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/scop-patches.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-659 alignleft\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/scop-patches-90x90.jpg\" alt=\"scopamine patches\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /><\/a><\/strong><strong>Scopolamine Patch\n<\/strong>This is one of the most effective methods of avoiding motion sickness. You'll get it by prescription from your doctor. It looks a bit like a small, round Band-Aid® that you stick behind your ear. The patch will last for a few days, so its recommended that you put it on the day before your trip so you have its full effect the day you're out. A small percentage of people have averse reactions to the patch (discuss these with your doctor), so that day before, it's probably better to limit driving until you're sure you're not reacting negatively.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bonine-adult.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-663\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bonine-adult-90x90.jpg\" alt=\"maui fishing seasick\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /><\/a><\/strong><strong>BONINE®:<\/strong>\nThis is the best pill form, over the counter remedy.  Ask for the name brand, not the generic. Bonine® has little to no side effects. Like the patch, it's better to get this working BEFORE you go out. Not the morning of your trip. Taking one dose of Bonine® the night before your fishing charter and another dose in the morning when you wake up. This isn't what the instructions say, but take my word for it. Taking a dose the day before works best.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sseaband.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-664\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sseaband-90x90.png\" alt=\"alternative cure seaickness\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /><\/a>Sea Band®:<\/strong>\nThese are pressure point therapy wrist bands, available at most drug stores. Most people scoff at these because it \"sounds\" like a scam.  They actually work pretty good. The nice thing about the SeaBand is that you can combine them any of the other methods without negative effects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ginger.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-665\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ginger-90x90.jpg\" alt=\"all natural sea sickness remedy\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /><\/a>Ginger:<\/strong>\nFor the naturopaths in the crowd, try ginger root. Ginger settles your stomach quickly and, just like with SeaBand®, ginger can be added along with any of the aforementioned remedies with no negative effects. You can get it as supplements, candied, raw, powdered, in cookies, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dramamine.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-662\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dramamine-90x90.jpg\" alt=\"dramamine\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /><\/a>Dramamine®<\/strong>\nIn our experience, it's not as effective as many items on the market and it'll make you really, really sleepy. Try for the Bonine first.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hagar-eat.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-941\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hagar-eat-90x90.jpg\" alt=\"hagar-eat\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /><\/a>DON'T OVER DO IT.\n<\/strong>It's best to limit/or avoid alcohol, dairy products, food high in salt, and generally heavier meals before or during travel.\n\n[clear]\n\n<strong>EYES ON THE HORIZON.<\/strong>\nIf possible, try to keep your eyes focused on the horizon. Avoid reading books, looking through binoculars, etc. In motion sickness, a discrepancy exists between the motion that is expected to occur and the actual motion sensed by the organ of balance in the inner ear. These unexpected signals translate into a confused message by the brain, leading to the development of symptoms. Watching the horizon will help to offset that confusion.\n\n<strong>IF ALL ELSE FAILS<\/strong>\nIf, despite your best efforts you find your gut rising in your throat, follow these simple rules.\n\n1) <strong>Stay above decks<\/strong> - do not rush for the head (marine toilet).\n\n2) Remember the old phrase \"never spit into the wind?\" Good. So make your way calmly to the LEEWARD side of the vessel and shoot for distance.\n\n&nbsp;",

				"Hawaii doesn't require any salt water fishing licenses. There are a few \"no fishing\" areas on all of the islands, but they don't front the hotels and they're clearly marked. There really aren't any restrictions on number of rods, type of bait, etc. etc.,  here. As long as you release your fish, there are few closed seasons. Most of the rules pertain to nets and diving/spearfishing and sale of the catch, virtually none pertain to hook and line release fishing.\n\nThere is no freshwater fishing on Maui (no lakes/streams/rivers with fish in them). Kauai and Oahu have some fresh water fishing.\n\nI do a lot of fishing in the \"mudflats\" area between Kihei and Maalaea Harbor. It's fairly close, easy access, not crowded and I can take my dog w/o a leash. It's on the ocean side of Kealia Wetland/Wildlife Sanctuary. Don't be tempted to drop a line in the freshwater side, it's a federal offense. It's clearly marked. I also fish in and around the Wailea/Makena area.\n\nI don't fish much down Lahaina/Kaanapali/Napili way, mainly because of the traffic, but there are many areas to fish that way.\n<h4><strong>GEAR &amp; BAIT\n<\/strong><\/h4>\nI generally 'whip' with a Daiwa BG-13 6#test 6.5' graphite rod, or a Penn SS 12# test on a 9.5' Fenwick e-glass. My dunking (bait) rod is a 12' Ugly Stik w/Shimano Baitrunner holding 17# test.\n\nWe use Kastmasters, Rebel windcheaters, Krocadiles, rapalas, scroungers, twister tails, glitter strips, wood egg floats, natural strip and live baits (shrimp, squid, octopus or fish). There aren't really bait stores, but you can get bait at most supermarkets.\n\nSquid is called 'ika' (ee-kah). Ika is a pretty good all around bait and it's pretty cheap. Foodland and Safeway both carry it. Don't thaw it in water unless you've sealed it a no-leak baggie. It 'sours' and the fish don't like it if it has turned reddish.\n\nPeel the thin membrane from the outside of the body, so it looks very white. Cut it in triangular strips 2-4\" long, 1/4-1/2\" wide, tapering to a point.\n\nYou can use the legs to make palu (chum). Chop it very fine and mix in a little cooking oil (the oil in tuna cans is good, if your family uses that type of tuna). Take a small can with a tight snap-on plastic lid and punch a bunch of small holes all over it. Tie the can to a long piece of fishing line (you're going to throw the can out a few feet up current from where you are fishing. The fishing line is so that you can retrieve the can. Put a small weight in it and put a handful of palu in it. Cheap cat food tuna works, too.\n\nIf the wind is directly offshore, you can also float the can. Attache the can to a small piece of wood out or foam. Again, attach a piece of line to the float for retrieval purpose.\n\nThe oil and small pieces of ika seep out and help attract fish to the area.\n\nIka is really freakin' stinky and the smell kind of sticks to your hands. It stains clothes, too, so don't where your favorite t-shirt or trunks when you're chopping the heads up.\n\nWhat I usually do is prep it all in advance and re-freeze the triangles between small sheets of waxed paper, and small baggies for the palu. Then I just take out enough for the morning/day.\n\nAnother good shore bait is aku belly. Ask at the fish counter in Foodland/Safeway. That's best fresh, it doesn't freeze/thaw well. Cut it in triangles, leave the skin on.\n\nI probably use a wood egg float w/ a 4' leader to a single hook and put on a glitter strip or twister tail or strip bait, more than anything else though. It kinda depends where I'm fishing.\n\nLike any other kind of fishing, fish like structure. Work both sides of rocky points on a beach, stream outflows(very few), sharp drop offs etc. Also, obviously, places that require a little more walking/climbing/4 WDrive are likely to be more productive than places that have easy access and get fished all the time. I'd recommend a <a title=\"Recommended Fishing Guides\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/other-fishing/shorefishing/shorefishing-guides/\">professional fishing guide<\/a> if you plan on going to any inaccessible areas.\n\nI grew up here so I don't really know the english names of all the fish. Papio is a trevally (jack) family – good fighting, good eating. After reaching about 15lbs. they're called ulua and are the most sought after (record is around 190#). Some guy caught a 563# sea bass here while fishing for ulua from the beach. Moana is a type of goatfish good eating and good bait for ulua. I think, wa'a nui is a snapper?. Don't know english equiv. of lai - leatherback or something. It's a good fighter. I ate it in Tahiti and it was good, but nobody here really eats it, we use the skin on lures. Kaku is barracuda. Needlefish called i'i sometimes referred to as 'poor man's marlin\" 'cause they often jump and tailwalk when hooked. There are also bonefish, milkfish and some others.\n\nYes, some of them bite, and some have sharp fins/scales, so you should handle them with gloves/care.\n\nAs to footwear, do you know what 'tabe's\" are? They are basically a rubber coated sock with a sole. They're made in Japan, but available here at any of the stores mentioned. Old tennies/deck shoes work too.\n\nI'd say bring your small spinning rig, 2-8 lbs (think small). Or bring a reel(s) and buy a cheap rod here at Sports Authority or K-Mart. Give it to a kid or leave it in the condo when you leave. It's cheaper than renting.\n\nSports Authority is on the same road  as the airport, so you have to drive by it , no matter what. A 7' spl 1100 Ugly Stik costs $29.99 and they have other fairly decent brands even cheaper. I tried one of their SouthBend 6.5' graphite composition rods awhile back. It felt a lot better than the $18 it cost. They also carry glitter strips, leads, egg floats etc. Long's Drugs also carries a pretty good assortment of tackle.\n<h3><b>Reader Comments\n<\/b><\/h3><blockquote><i>\"Thanks for advice captain mike.  it took a couple mornings to find a spot where the fish didn't break me off in the coral and rocks, but when i did, i hooked some screamers.<\/i><i>the first  morning all i caught were puffers and eels on the shrimp i must have been too close to the bottom with my bait.  i tied on a rattle trap that i brought from home, and the very first two casts, two fish on that took off parallel with the shoreline and broke me off.   out of time, and out of rattlers, i went home a little discouraged, but happy to have amazingly strong fish on.  but what were they, and how could i land one????<\/i><i>the next couple mornings i fished north of the noeloni condos about a mile on the edge of a big beach and a rocky point.  i ran a 3-way swivel with about a 4 foot drop on light line to my lead ball which would hang in the rocks/coral.  on the 3rd eyelet of the swivel, i tied on a heavy leader about 18-22'', and a long shank hook with bait barbs that held my shrimp in place perfectly when making the gorilla cast to get out as far as possible after wading as far as was safe.  the first couple casts, i didn't FEEL the bait to the bottom, and i lost my shrimp.  the next cast, i felt the take as my lead hit the bottom, waited for a two count, and set the hook.  the first fish was a big leather skin jack that took off like a torpedo.  turning it's head toward the beach was key to landing him after he stripped about 150 feet of line off my reel. the very next cast, i set the hook too soon as i was a little excited by now, and lost my shrimp and no fish.  the 4th cast i hooked a monster bonefish that took about 10 minutes to land after he stripped 150' (twice)!!!  I ended up in front of the next condo units and about 40 vacationers, who cheered me on when i landed him, and another big cheer when i let him go.  it was the first bonefish i've ever caught.  at this point i was already late to catch my plane so i gave my remaining shrimp, 3 way swivels and lead balls to a guy from rhode island who was also fishing, but hadn't caught anything.  he helped me land the fish and took the photos.  i hope he caught some fish, but his 6' rod probably didn't reach as far as needed, but who knows...thanks again and i can't wait to come back..<\/i><i>8 1/2 foot ugly stick, 15 lb line, 6 lb drop line (you want this to break off), 20 lb leader.  this is my pike and steelhead rod back home.  it worked perfectly.<\/i><i>Bad weather cancelled our trolling trip that you had led us too, so we didn't get to big game fish...<\/i><i>thanks again,\neric h<\/i><\/blockquote><i>-------------------------<\/i><blockquote><i>Aloha Capt. Mike,<\/i><i>Also, thanks for the tips on shore fishing. I took a reel and some lures as you suggested - just bought a rod when I got there (gave it to a kid when I left, sure did make his day!). Did best at the mudflats between Kihei and Maalaea near the Wildlife Sanctuary, we caught lots of bonefish on a blue/silver rattle-trap ãbleeding shadä pattern. Never fished for them before, but WOW ö what a trip !!  Certainly a fighting fish of the highest order.  Once again, my wife had a great time there, which makes the trip all that much better when momma enjoys fishing ;)<\/i><i>A big Mahalo for all your help and great tips. Trust me; anybody that is going to Maui and is even thinking about fishing is getting two thumbs up to call you and  definite  high marks for the guys on the ACTION.<\/i><i>Mahalo\nGreg &amp; Katy L.<\/i><\/blockquote><i>-------------------------<\/i><blockquote><i>Thanks for the info Mike.  I had a great time fishing in Maui until my reel busted!!!  Couldn't cast!!.  I found a great spot at the very south end of la perouse bay, as far as you can walk on the lava trail, it opens up to a little beach through the trees on the right.  If you walk out on the rocky point there are some great spots where the reef drops off a good 20 feet straight down with tons of fish!!! Thanks again!!\nDerek N.<\/i><\/blockquote><i>--------------------<\/i><blockquote><i>Aloha Mike!!!<\/i><i>I came, I saw, I conquered!\n<\/i><i>I fished just north of the Royal Lihiana Resort and caught a 5' needle fish (great fight on 8# test line), several types of grouper (fun fighters - presented some problems getting into the corral, but patiently I eventually won!) and a Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (Gosh it is fun to just learn how to say that, even though saying Trigger fish is so much easier!!).<\/i><i>I was casting everything the locals said wouldn't work (Mn. Walleye, and Northern Pike lures) so it made me feel like I did something special. A silver/blue 1/2 oz Rattle Trap was my hottest bait. I think the grouper loved the sound of the rattles and just hit like freight trains. I also used 7' Med Action Graphite spinning rod, 8# green Trilene XL line, and 1/2 oz plastic minnows called Storm Lures in Blue or Yellow and caught Needle fish. The 5' long needle fish hit the Yellow Storm 4\" Minnow. GREAT FIGHT!!!! He burned line like I couldn't believe. A silver, and a gold 3/8 oz Northland Buck shot Rattle spoon (for ice fishing here) also caught some grouper. I never even broke out a Kastmaster type spoon.<\/i><i>I even had some luck snorkling out and hand line jigging for needle fish and Trigger fish with a small blue and silver rubber bodied jig a local con'ed me into buying.<\/i><i>Everyone on the shore was laughing watching the crazy guy from Mn. - Land of 10,000 lakes catching fish when they had watched locals fish all week and not catch anything. They all really laughed seeing me snorkel out to undo snags on corral, and about died laughing seeing me snorkeling and jigging below me as I swam. BUT I CAUGHT FISH!!!!<\/i><i>Thank you for response. I appreciated it, and it made my trip to catch something. My wife thinks I am her hero! I released everything caught happy, and healthy. I hope someone else gets to share in this wonderful colorful experience!<\/i><i>Saw a ton of whales too....THAT WAS COOL.<\/i><i>Mahalo, (I hope I got this THANK YOU right)\n<\/i><i>Bill W.<\/i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNeed more???\n\nI don't do this very often, but here is a really accurate older post I found recently. Not sure how I missed it before! The author may have been living in Hilo at the time, but the info is applicable to Hawaii as a whole.\n\nIt's a must read if you plan to fish here on your own.\n<a title=\"shorefish hawaii\" href=\"http://www.ifish.net/board/showthread.php?t=434106\" target=\"_blank\">SHOREFISH HAWAII<\/a><\/blockquote>",

Indeed, summer fishing can be marked by a day or two of the doldrums where practically no boat catches, followed by a day or two of high activity where many boats catch, often including a number of impressive specimens.\n\nJune and early July we can see decent <strong>ono<\/strong> (wahoo) bites. Come August, ono tend to drop off, though last year the ono bite surprised many with a burst of activity in August. <strong>Mahi mahi<\/strong> (dorado / dolphin fish), while arguably Maui's most common gamefish, is a bit harder to come by during the summer.\n\nInshore fishing with lighter tackle is decent this time of year. For the youngest anglers, blueline snapper are numerous. Grey snapper (uku) and trevally both peak during the summer and can make for an exciting fight on light tackle whether you're fishing from a boat or from the shore. I've heard captains complain about the live bait bite during the summer. Sometimes it just seems \"off\". One other drawback this time of year is the weather. The air can be hot. And still. Particularly towards the end of August.\n<h3><strong>SUMMER WEATHER <\/strong><\/h3>\nAbsent during the summer are the Kona storms, which can bring torrents of rain and high winds from the south. Summer is hot. Muggy. The winds blow acrid, dusty air around in the afternoons. Locals quietly yearn for the cool, brief afternoon showers that fall like clockwork in the spring. Get offshore... get far offshore. Hook into that marlin of a lifetime and then toss back a cold one.\n<h3><strong>CHARTER AVAILABILITY <\/strong><\/h3><h4>Coming to Maui this summer? I'd advise you to book your Maui fishing charter well in advance! Here's why..<\/h4><ul><li><strong>Group travel is UP. <\/strong>A lot of extended families and their guests come to Maui for weddings. Fishing boats that can take more than six people will be in high demand. There are currently only four fishing vessels – two out of Lahaina Harbor and two out of Maalaea Harbor – licensed to carry more than 6 passengers. These boats fill up quickly mid-May to mid-July.<\/li><li><strong>Many families with children travel to Maui in the early summer months.<\/strong> There aren't many of the fishing boats that will take kids under 8 fishing, even on a private trip. The best kid-friendly boats are often booked out a month in advance or more. <a title=\"Contact\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact/\">Contact me<\/a> for specific referrals for your family fishing trip.<\/li><li><strong>Summer fishing tournaments!<\/strong> As the marlin bite peaks, so naturally do the number of fishing tournaments, making vessel availability even more sparse. Maui's <em>Wahine Fishing Tournament<\/em> at the end of May,the<em> Blue Marlin World Cup (Worldwide)<\/em> on July 4 may cut into vessel availability. Some boats simply shut down for a couple of weeks to fish the tournament circuit. Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii plays host to most of the regional and international fishing tournaments throughout July and August. Some Maui fishing boats travel over there for up to weeks at a time, putting them out of the charter lineup.<\/li><\/ul>\nSo just to repeat... <a title=\"Reservations\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/reservations/\">make a fishing reservation<\/a> as soon as possible if you plan on visiting Maui during the summer....Don't make me have to say \"I told you so!\" ;-)",

Tad and <a title=\"Reel Luckey\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/reel-luckey/\">Reel Luckey<\/a> for our fishing adventure while on our honeymoon. Granted we had the most spectacular weather for the day and the always choppy waters of Maui resembled many of the lakes and ponds Colleen and I fish back home in New Hampshire.\n\nThe guys were ready to rock and roll as soon as we arrived, we were actually early by 20mins which they really loved. We slammed the bait right off the bat, which Tad explained is rare but we took advantage of what was given to us that day and headed out to one of his special spots. We were not fishing for 20min when we hit a fish, Colleen was up and she handled the light tackle like a pro and landed a nice amber jack about 25lbs. Later we had a miss by a hungry ono, then the fun really began. With the weather conditions we had and the type of fishing methods Capt. Tad uses trolling live bait at slow speeds set us up for two spectacular shows by two giant ono. My fish came up to the bait and just swam behind it checking it out, then Tad tapped the gas on the boat and pulled the bait away from the fish. As you may expect this hungry ono did not like this and he exploded through the water and took the bait. I have fished for King Salmon which are known for their epic runs but this fish's initial run made all those look like a joke, searing speed and a awesome fight. My fish measured in at 64\" long and they guessed at least 55lbs, Brian stated that it was the biggest ono he had ever seen. Colleens 45+lb ono had an even more epic strike (aerial show) which I missed but she did a great job fighting the fish. I have never seen her smile so big in my life and I was so proud of her for fighting that fish all the way in. We landed one more ono about 35lbs, all three fish didn't fit into the cooler which was wicked awesome. We left the boat with about 10lbs of ono, which is the best fish I have ever eaten in my life (can see why ono means delicious in Hawaiian). Capt. Tad gave us a great recipe and we cooked it in our room later that night, we ate ono for two days straight YUM!\n\nCapt. Tad and Brain are my kind of people and they love to fish as much as we do. They were super guides showing us how to jig up mackerel, how to rig the baits, how to fight certain fish, laid out game plans for when we got a bite, encouraged us when we were fighting the fish, and where just as excited as us when we landed our big ono's (Brian was shaking as much as I was). I could go on and on about these two guys; they enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed them. It was all in all a home run and I would fish with these guys any day and plan to in the future. I love their fishing style, how they conduct themselves, and their love for the adventure.\n\nTo be honest if we didn't catch a fish it would still have been a great day with these guys because just being out there enjoying the water with Tad and Brain was worth the price of admission. Again thank you so much for helping us pick the right charter, you really know what your doing and I would recommend anyone to talk to you about booking a fishing trip on Maui.\n\nTake care,\n-Shane Keyes\n[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"1349,1350,1351,1352,1353\"]",

				"Maui Shore fishing guide <a title=\"Shore fishing guides\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/other-fishing/shorefishing/shorefishing-guides/\">Brian Edmisson<\/a> reports the oama are running strong lately. Oama make excellent live bait for attracting the larger fish like papio and omilu.\n\n<strong>Oama<\/strong><em>(pronounced o-wa'-ma)<\/em> are juvenile goatfish that come in shore when they reach roughly 4-5\" in length in search of shrimp, worms, etc. During the summer months they can be found gathering in huge schools in the shallows off Hawaii's beaches. Numbering in the thousands sometimes, Oama will hang out in the same general area for a weeks at a time – great news for anglers who may want to pick up a couple dozen or more.\n\nIt's not uncommon during the summer to see throngs of Maui shore fishermen, keiki included, in knee deep water, scanning the shallows for the schools in the hopes of filling a small container with these delicate fish. If used for bait, the small fish must be kept alive, which can prove a challenge even to the most seasoned angler.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/oama.gif\" alt=\"oama (juvenile goatfish)\" width=\"360\" height=\"223\" />\n\nNot only do oama make good bait fish, they're also delicious in and of themselves. While some locals may eat them raw with a bit of salt, or whole, battered and fried, it's probably wiser to take the time to gut them and skin them. And avoid the head. This is where toxins may accumulate.\n\nWhile no one has yet gotten sick from smaller oama, the larger weke (goatfish) have been known to cause illness accompanied by hallucinations.\n\nSymptoms develop within the first 2 hours and include tingling around the mouth, sweating, weakness, hallucinations and tightness in the chest. The poison will affect some people during sleep, causing vivid nightmares. Because of this, some call the band-tailed goatfish \"the nightmare weke.\" Hawaiians called this same fish \"weke pahulu\" (chief of the ghosts).",

				"I would like to give you a huge Mahalo, for setting us up with Die Hard Fishing!  What an awesome time!\n\nJust a little history....we were scheduled for our fishing trip on Saturday. Of course we had \"weather\" on the previous Thursday, with tons of wind and rain.  Upon arrival at the dock, Fuzzie, informed us of the sea conditions, and the small craft warnings that had been issued. Allowing us to make the decision if we were willing to tough it out, or call it a day.  I asked him if he could rate it on a 1 - 5 scale, (5 being the most difficult) what were the conditions.  He said \"a 4.\"  Okay, let's go for it!\n\nSo out we went.  The seas were very rough, but we were out for a GREAT trip!  Fuzzie, and his partner, (I won't even try to venture his name or spelling, a young man, late teens) were both professional, and courteous.  They both made us feel welcome, and were obviously happy doing what they do!  They worked in harmony, and grace even in the roughest of sea!  I am still amazed at the ability the two of them have together!  They make an excellent team!\n\nDue to the high sea warning, we didn't see any other boats in the areas that we were fishing in, thus giving us a fishing trip of a life time!  The fish wouldn't stay off the lines!  Many times, there were 4 fish just waiting to be brought in.  My husband did most of the work, as my arms gave out quickly.  Those Tuna can really sound!\n\nWe are thoroughly and completely satisfied with the trip, and it was worth every cent we invested!\n\nThanks again\nKristi B.",

				"First let me thank you for setting up the trips I enjoyed the first week of April.  Recall that I booked full day charters on the Reel Lucky on 4/3 and 4/5.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2086\" title=\"Reel Luckey reviews: ono caught 4/3/13\" alt=\"Reel Luckey reviews: ono caught 4/3/13\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RL-jannausch1-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><strong>Reel Lucky 4/3<\/strong> -  We caught one Mahi Mahi and an ONO.  I brought two guests, it was a calm day and the crew was knowledgeable and fun.  We had a great time.  The boat was clean and comfortable.  The crew was on time and ready to go as scheduled.  The crew swapped baits a number of times in an effort to catch more fish.\n\n<strong>Reel Lucky 4/5<\/strong> - I caught a bunch of small yellow fin tuna and a Mahi Mahi. I was the sole guest on the boat and having met the crew on Wednesday no intro and training was necessary.  I had a great time, the crew was a lot of fun.  We tried multiple fishing techniques with success with each.  Like Monday and Wednesday it was what I expected offshore fishing to be.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2084\" title=\"Reel Luckey reviews from Jannausch\" alt=\"Reel Luckey reviews from Jannausch\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RL-jannausch3-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />Overall, Lili looking at the number and types of flags run by the charters after the day of fishing we did better than most people each day.  Which brings me to [an important] point. Customers' expectations need to be managed.  Here is what I mean.  I talked to a number of charter guests on the dock, at my hotel, and in the plane, without exception there was disappointment with the number of fish they caught.  ... Clearly they expected more for their money.  All had only booked a half day or a six hour charter.  None were multiple days like me.  So to go out with 4 to 6 people on the boat for 4 to 6 hours and catch nothing and pay whatever is not a lot of fun for most people. I had a great time for two reasons.  My value is based on experience over three days not one 1/2 day charter.\n\nSo that's it...Let me finish by saying I had a great time and want to thank you for setting it all up for me.\n\nJim J.\n<blockquote><em>Editor's note - As per client request, Reel Luckey fished offshore for big game on these two charters.

				"To be totally honest, I really hate the review systems that currently exist online. At least when it comes to reviewing Maui fishing charters. There are so many factors that go into a good charter which are of no fault of the vessel. No fish. Poor weather. Unpleasant fellow anglers. Or just simply the wrong trip for you/your party.\n\nFor example, I for one would not recommend sending my 75 year old Aunt Tilly out to ride along with Cousin Bob on an 8+ hour trip that leaves at 0200 hours no mateter how good their catch rate is. Similarly, I probably wouldn't suggest a 4 hour shared bottom fishing trip to anyone looking to put dinner on the table for a family of 6 back at the condo.\n\nSo read the fishing reviews below. If a boat doesn't appear on this list, it's only because no one has reviewed them yet!\n<h2>Maui Sport Fishing Charters<\/h2><h3>Hinatea sport fishing reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"1395\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n<h3>Action sport fishing reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"230\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n<h3><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />Start Me Up charters reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"776\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n<h3>Reel Luckey fishing charter reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"36\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n<h3>Excellence luxury yacht charters reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"1978\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n<h3>Rascal Charters reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"1363\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n<h3>Piper Charters reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"2429\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaui Bottom Fishing Reviews\n<h3>Marjorie Ann bottom fishing reviews<\/h3>\n[WPCR_SHOW POSTID=\"494\" NUM=\"15\" SNIPPET=\"200\" MORE=\"More\" HIDECUSTOM=\"0\" HIDERESPONSE=\"1\"]",

Other snacks are very much welcome, whether it be a bag of mochi crunch, chips, or granola bars…. grapes are okay. So why can’t you bring a <i>banana?<\/i><\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Two words: “BAD LUCK.”<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I haven’t found any information of original dates for the belief that bananas are bad luck on fishing boats, however the main focus of the legend is that if there are bananas on board:<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><ul><li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">the fish won’t bite<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">the boat will experience mechanical failures<\/span><\/li><li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">assorted mayhem, destruction, and general bad juju will run rampant until the offending bananas (or related items) are tossed off the ship.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This belief isn’t just limited to Hawaii. In places all over the word, anti-banana sentiment still exists among the maritime community. So where does the belief come from?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are a couple of explanations that I find particularly plausible, many dating back to the first long distance sailors. These long voyages required food. In tropical climates, bananas may have seemed like the perfect option (who <i>doesn’t<\/i> love food that comes with it’s own natural packaging). But bananas, while ripening, release ethylene gas. This gas has a tendency to spoil other food very quickly. Bringing bananas on board was most likely a surefire way to ruin other produce stored near them. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Bananas also make a lovely home for little nasties such as insects, snakes, and bacteria- especially when stored for a long time!<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, because of bananas natural buoyancy, in the event of a shipwreck oftentimes the only visible reminder of a sunken ship would be bunches of bananas bobbing menacingly on the surface. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fishing is fishing, and nothing can guarantee a successful day... but why risk it? Whether you’re superstitious or not, please leave the bananas at home.<\/span><\/p>",

That smooth-talking-Morgan-Freeman inner voice that lulls many an angler into a zen state as they gaze at the horizon is pretty much ignored by most kids under the age of 10 or 11.\n\nThat's not to say kids won't enjoy a Maui fishing trip, it's just that you'll need to keep things interesting for them between hookups. And believe me, the time between hookups on a Maui sport fishing charter can sometimes be longer than we'd like.\n\nThose of you who chuckle to yourselves, saying <em>\"the kids will come with us whether they like it or not\"<\/em> are in for an extra special treat if the fishing happens to be slow. Spending 8 hours on a sport fishing charter with a sullen 8 year old who REALLY didn't want to be there in the first place can make for an exquisitely miserable trip.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that children are quite susceptible to sea sickness; often more than adults. Be sure to read my page about <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/avoiding-seasickness/\">Avoiding Seasickness<\/a>.\n\nNow that I have the caveats out of the way, here are my general recommendations for Maui fishing with kids broken down by age groups...\n\n<strong>Kids aged 0 - 3:<\/strong> Keep them back on shore. A Maui fishing charter is not the place for toddlers. It's uninteresting for them, and potentially unsafe. If you do plan on bringing a toddler out on any kind of charter, I'd recommend bringing your own PFD (personal floatation device). Most boats don't carry life jackets that will fit children that young.\n\n<strong>Kids aged 4-7: <\/strong> In my opinion, a <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats\">Maui sport fishing charter<\/a> is not appropriate for children under the age of 8. Sport fishing is usually conducted farther offshore, where sea conditions can be unpredictable, perhaps even unsafe for younger children who don't understand the importance of holding on until it's too late. If you insist on bringing a younger child, book a private charter, and keep it under 6 hours.\n\nA <a title=\"Bottom fishing boats\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/\">bottom fishing trip<\/a> is best for the young ones. 4 hours, inshore. The equipment is light enough for most of them to manage. But even a 4 hour trip may feel long to some children, so if you're \"doing this for the kids\", get a single rod per adult/child pair on a shared bottom fishing trip. Better yet, book a private. Customizing a bottom fishing charter for a family makes the charter more enjoyable for everyone involved.\n\n<strong>Kids aged 8-14:<\/strong> Here's where your knowledge of your own children plays an important role. If your kids have shown a genuine interest in fishing, are realistic and patient, you may be able to take them on a <a title=\"Sport fishing boats\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/\">offshore sportfishing trip<\/a>. Keep in mind however that the gear on an offshore trolling trip is heavy, and reeling often takes more upper body strength than an 8 or even a 10 year old can muster.\n\nA private charter is required for any children under the age of 12. There are 1 or 2 sport fishing boats that will include some light tackle and/or bottom fishing time if you book on private charter basis. For most of them, the minimum age is 8.\n\n<strong>Aged 14 and up...<\/strong> Looking for that perfect father &amp; son fishing experience on Maui? It's out there. How about a 4-6 hour guided shore fishing expedition for two? This, or any of our regular sport fishing charters would be appropriate for those aged 14 and up.\n\nWhen you're ready to book, give me a call at <a style=\"cursor: pointer;\">808-344-3520<\/a>, or fill out a reservation inquiry form on this page and I'll get back to you with recommendations and availability.",

				"<h4 style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">September, October, November<\/h4><strong>FISHING: <\/strong>\nThe larger blue marlin that show up in Maui waters during the summer months are tapering off, though a few big ones can still be caught in September. Big Eye\" is the prize when it comes to Tuna. Not many of the larger yellowfin around this time of year. Quite a few smaller aku, \"shebi\".\n\nMahi mahi (dorado) can still be caught in the fall too. Marlin hookups, while they do occur, are rarer as winter approaches. Strikes that do occur do so farther offshore.\n\nBy mid-October, the inshore fishing is picking up. Bottom fishing, inshore lighter tackle sport fishing, shore fishing – they're all good options in the fall. Remember Maui's game fish are caught every month of the year here.  The longer you fish for the better your odds.\n\n<strong>MAUI WEATHER:<\/strong>\nSeptember is still considered summer here. The days can be hot and muggy, and the trade winds that blow with regularity in the summer afternoons are starting to drop off a bit. Cooler out on the water, of course. While hurricanes and tropical storms are not all that common, it is during the month of September that they occur with the most frequency. Continuing on into October and November, we see a slight cooling off (low 80's instead of high 80s, low 90's), and increasing though still intermittent rainfall is more likely, with the occasional \"winter storm\" being pretty commonplace towards the end of November.\n\n<strong>CHARTER AVAILABILITY:<\/strong><strong>September<\/strong> is kind of a 'catch your breath month' for the fishing boats on Maui. Things tend to slow down for a few weeks after Labor Day. Take care booking share boats if it's just 1 or 2 of you. If the trip is not confirmed and business is slow, you can easily get bumped. Some boats are better about not bumping shares than others. If you're hoping to share a charter, then <a title=\"Contact\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact/\"><strong>contact me<\/strong><\/a>. I'll help you get set up.\n\n<strong>October<\/strong> brings the Lahaina Jackpot Fishing Tournament and the Halloween Shootout Tournament. From around Oct. 24th through the 3rd of November, many boats are unavailable for charter. That means the few that are will be in high demand.\n\n<strong>November<\/strong> visitor crowds peak the weekend before Thanksgiving. It is very busy here during Thanksgiving week. After Thanksgiving week, things get quiet again until after the second week of December, when we ready ourselves for the busiest time of the year on Maui.",

				"<h4 style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">March, April and May<\/h4><strong>FISHING<\/strong>\nWhile spring may not be the optimum time for the big blue marlin, many of the other <a title=\"Maui gamefish\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/mauifishing/maui-gamefish\">Maui gamefish<\/a> are reaching good numbers. May in particular can be a very productive month to fish off Maui, Hawaii. All in all, spring fishing off Maui can be an exciting time both inshore, and offshore.\n\n<strong>Mahi mahi (dorado)<\/strong> is arguably Maui's most frequently caught gamefish. They can be caught year round. but in April and May we see the greatest numbers.\n\n<strong>Ono (wahoo)<\/strong> are a common catch near the end of April, with May and June being their most abundant months.\n\n<strong>Striped marlin<\/strong> begin appearing in greater numbers in February. March and April they're more common. 20-30 years ago we'd find them schooling in packs. They'd enthusiastically hit lures and bait. This was affectionately referred to as a \"rat attack\" and made for some exciting offshore sportfishing. We don't see this much here anymore.\n\n<strong>Shortbilled spearfish<\/strong>, while less common than stripers, are also caught more frequently in the spring and summer.\n\n<strong>Blue marlin<\/strong> caught in April and May are usually in the 100 - 200lb range. The larger marlin over 300lbs are caught more often in the summer. But not always!\n\n<strong>WEATHER:<\/strong>\nWinter storms begin to loose their punch towards the end of March, and the weather is often about as perfect as it gets here by mid to late April. Plenty of sunshine, but not uncomfortably hot (we get enough of that in August &amp; September). Tradewinds are and steady in the afternoons, often followed by brief \"windward and mauka showers\", which keep everything lush and green. Best of all The fishing is starting to get REALLY good! An added plus: in March the whales are still here, and quite active, as the last of the male humpbacks try to attract a female before the long swim back to Alaskan waters.\n\nAs May approaches, the weather begins to get warmer, with the trades getting progressively stronger, particularly on the north and windward coasts. Out on the water the additional heat can be welcome, but with the stronger winds, you'll want to get out on the water as early as possible.<strong><\/strong><strong>CHARTER AVAILABILITY:<\/strong>\nPlanning a visit for Spring Break? You're not alone. Schools have their holidays at different times, so the crowds are spread out a bit, but generally, from Mid March through the first week of April things are hopping here. As always, if a fishing trip is on your to do list then book early.  The best boats will most likely be filled up.",

				"<h4 style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">  DECEMBER, JANUARY, FEBRUARY<\/h4><strong>FISHING: <\/strong><strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bigeye.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1936\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bigeye-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"big eye tuna\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" /><\/a><\/strong>Winter is sort of a \"catch your breath\" month for the Maui sport fishing industry. Fishing is good, but with fewer \"hot\" bites like we see in the summer. Big Eye tuna are in season during the winter. Big Eye are sometimes confused with yellowfin tuna (except they are fatter with...bigger eyes. Go figure). Both species are simply referred to as \"ahi\".  Since Big Eye are deep water tuna, they're most often hooked by those boats leaving wickedly early and reaching the buoys at first light, like <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/diehard\"><em>Die Hard<\/em><\/a> and <em><a title=\"Action\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/action\">Action<\/a><\/em>. They are not caught every day, but when you do, break out the wasabi!! The mahi bite is still consistent, and striped marlin are showing up more in January.\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1689 alignleft\" title=\"amberjack\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/13_DSCF0005-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"amber jack\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />The inshore bite can be really good during the winter. Plenty of amberjack to be found. Travally, snapper. So if you're on the fence as to whether to book a <a title=\"Bottom fishing boats\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats\">Maui bottom fishing charter<\/a> or a <a title=\"Sport fishing charters\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats\">sport fishing charter<\/a>, bottom fishing can be a good choice this time of year. Granted the fish will most likely be a lot smaller, but you'll probably catch more of them. A couple of sport fishing boats are outfitted with downriggers which are often effective this time of year. <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact-2\">Contact me<\/a>. I'll get you hooked up! <a title=\"Shore fishing guides\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/other-fishing/shorefishing/shorefishing-guides\">Guided shorefishing<\/a> and spearfishing is also very good this time of year.\n\n<strong>MAUI WINTER WEATHER:\n<\/strong>Where summer is thought of as the windy season, marked by strong, consistent trades, winter is Maui's \"rainy season\". Fortunately, thanks to Maui's numerous micro climates, unless you're spending a lot of time in East Maui, or upcountry you may not notice. The two most popular tourist areas of south and west Maui remain comparatively dry. South Maui in particular (Kihei &amp; Wailea) is the most consistently sunny region of the island. Lahaina and Kaanapali will see a few more showers, though they are usually brief, and keep things lush and green. Windward sides of the island will be the wettest. If you're planning a drive to Hana, absolutely be sure to check the weather and driving conditions before you leave. Roads are sometimes blocked.\n\nWhen storms do blow through (\"Kona storms\" begin making appearances in late October and into the winter), then can last for a few days at a time, dumping torrents of water island-wide). As for the sea conditions, winter is a time where you can experience extended calms – mornings with flat glassy waters are not uncommon, particularly off Lahaina where the afternoon winds are often blocked by the West Maui Mountains.\n\n<strong>CHARTER AVAILABILITY:<\/strong><strong>December<\/strong> is two-faced. Up until about the 20th, it's very quiet on Maui. It's easier to get a vessel for a private charter within a week of your visit than it is for a shared trip unless there are already 4 of you so the charter is confirmed. Parties of 1 or 2 may have to be flexible in their fishing dates. After December 20th it's a different story. The holiday season is upon us and the hotels and condos fill up almost overnight. For the week between Christmas and New Years, you'll be hard pressed to get on a top catch boat if you haven't already booked by mid-November. <strong>January<\/strong> ... Busy for the first two weeks, then it drops off slightly. <strong>February<\/strong> ... Busy throughout the month.\n\n&nbsp;",
				"Up until about the 20th, it's very quiet on Maui. It's easier to confirm private Maui fishing charters within a week of your visit than it is to book a shared charter unless there are already 4.

Well, yes and no. The fish don't care much, but captains are at the mercy of a humpback's movements. Federal regulations prohibit approaching humpback whales (by any means) within 100 yards (90 m) when on or in the water. These regulations apply to all ocean users, year-round throughout the Hawaiian Islands, except as authorized under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).\n\nThe first humpback whales of the season were sighted off Mala wharf in Lahaina on October 14, 2014. The whales will continue to be seen here through about mid-April, with the height of the season falling during the end of February, beginning of March. While there are fewer humpback whales towards the end of March, those that are around are often very active and gather in larger pods (what we used \"heat runs\"). IMHO, the last 2 weeks of march is just about the best time to whale watch off Maui!\n\nIf you're visiting Maui between Jan - March, and you're vacillating between a fishing charter and whale watching, then consider combining the two!\n<h4>Can we whale watch on our Maui fishing charter?<\/h4>\nFishing charter captains will stop their engines or at least slow down considerably if whales are nearby. Understandably, most captains will want to get outside of the 100 yard limit and get back to sport fishing as soon as possible unless you've told them you want to see the whales.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2156\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/whales2.jpg\" alt=\"whales2\" width=\"300\" height=\"451\" />There are a few boats that enjoy a bit of whale watching. Plus they're good at it!  So if you'd like to combine a few hours of fishing with an hour or two of whale watching let me know. I'll put you on the right boat! You'll want a private charter. Not a share since others on board your share trip may not share your enthusiasm.\n<h4>Does the presence of whales affect fishing in Maui?<\/h4>\nEvery year, we receive email from folks who have the erroneous idea that Maui gamefish are afraid of the whales. Baloney!!!\n\nIt's my belief that the gamefish could care less. Humpbacks aren't actively feeding during the winter months. The whales pose no threat to the fish. Sure they're big, but fish have speed and agility on their side. That said, having whales around CAN affect an offshore trolling trip. You can't successfully troll for marlin if you're moving at no-wake speed. As I mentioned, the boats are required to slow, or move outside 100 yards.\n<h4>Amazing whale encounter<\/h4>\nOne of the boats we book regularly had an amazing whale encounter last year. This particular humpback \"whale mugging\" went on for a little over 30 minutes. Believe me, this is NOT your normal whale watching experience! I worked with the Pacific Whale Foundation for roughly 3 years back in the late 80's. I was on the water nearly 8 hours per day documenting whale behavior and I never had a whale experience quite like this one.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"blue button medium\" title=\"Maui Whale Mugging\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlgGssj4SbE\">Watch Video<\/a><\/p>",

The vessel is outfitted for private and share boat Lahaina bottom fishing charters. She can accommodate up to 12 passengers (maximum 8 anglers) and thereby joins only three other fishing boats on Maui licensed to carry more than 6 passengers.\n\nJimmy Akana (captain) describes Cooper V as ideally suited for successful light tackle fishing; fast and maneuverable with a 350hp turbo diesel engine, she gets anglers to the reef fast. On private charters (and weather permitting) they'll sometimes speed out across the channel to Lanai to reach productive locations not ordinarily fished. The vessel is equipped with an array of 15 pound spinning tackle, a bait-cutting station, and a state-of-the-art Simrad fish finder. This combination of speed, well maintained gear, modern electronics and solid local knowledge will put clients on the bite!\n\nJimmy started fishing Maui waters in '94. Since then his fishing experience has expanded throughout the Pacific, to include crewing down on the Great Barrier for black marlin, to running private sport fishers through Central America and Mexico. The last 14 years he's been spending his summers running a fishing operation – mostly bottomfishing – out of Seward Alaska. After that he warms up and returns to Maui to lead bottom fishing charters for Valley Isle visitors.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1869\" title=\"cooperv - west maui's latest light tackle option\" alt=\"cooperv - west maui's latest light tackle option\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cooperv-photo-300x224.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" />The <strong>Cooper V<\/strong> is owned by UFO Adventures, and was previously used for water sport activities such as wake boarding, knee-boarding, banana boat rides, tubing and snorkeling. As of this writing, she is still available for such trips on a custom charter basis (charged by the hour). This could change however, as word spreads and the team fine tunes their light tackle fishing niche. I for one, am painfully aware of the need for expanded fishing options beyond deepsea trolling off Lahaina and Ka'anapali Maui!\n\nThe single drawback I see in this boat right now is the lack of an enclosed marine head (bathroom). In \"emergency situations\" the boat is equipped with a portable head, which I'm sure is just fine for uninhibited men enjoying a morning of fishing, beer and social bonding. But for the majority of women and kids, a little privacy goes a long way.  For this reason, until clients tell me otherwise, I'll be recommending private charters more often than share boats, and suggest that readers \"take care of business\" before they board the boat!\n\n<a title=\"Cooper V\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/cooperv\">For charter details and prices click here<\/a>\n\n&nbsp;",

About <span data-term=\"goog_1191931690\">5:50 <\/span>or so his son shows up and said that his father broke his leg the day before and could not come. But the son, Ben, was coming. So we headed off with the full moon setting over Lana’i.\n\nJust about half mile from the harbor Capt. Denny said he could hear a noise, not that I could, so he had Ross the 1<sup>st<\/sup> mate go down to take a look. The noise was from the fan belt on one of the engines, I was thinking oh no, we are headed back in. Capt. Denny went down and fixed the belt.\n\nBack on track over to the south side of Lana’i. Some of the waves started to get big and I was not feeling great but Ross took us over all the equipment and how to sit the chair. He was great in taking his time so we could understand. The sun was up and the mountains of west Maui appeared out of the normal clouds that are over it this time of year, what a view. So Ross give us our pole numbers and we sat back to enjoy the best blue ocean in the world.\n\n\"We had motored around back and forth across the coast of Lana’i for a few hours. Ross was adjusting the #3 pole which was my wife’s. He yelled out “fish on” and called her number. My wife Patti was a little afraid to come down from the upper deck as it was a little rough. I headed down and Ross got me all setup. I was more like a bull in a glass store but he helped me get into the chair and the fight was on. I saw the fish jump as I was coming down from above and knew that it was the biggest fish I had ever had on a line. The fish ran the line out for some time and Capt. Denny was doing a great job with the boat. As Ross helped me lock up I started to reel him in. My arm was getting tried after 10 minutes or so and that was the time that Ross locked me to the chair and pole. This helped a lot but I was pulling to hard and a few times pulled the pole out of the base. Ross helped me the whole way. I reeled and reeled, getting more tired as I went but Capt. Denny drove the boat just right to give me a break.\n\nAfter about a half hour we had two lines and the fish on the side of the boat. They both got the fish alongside and into the boat. We fished the rest of the day without a bite but the day was beautiful. We got back to shore and the guys on shore said that the fish was not a blue marlin but a black marlin. They said that one had not been caught in 12 years. So that was very cool for me.\n\nCapt. Denny and Ross [<a title=\"Start Me Up\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\">Start me Up Charters<\/a>] did an outstanding job and anytime I am back in Maui I will be going out with them. Thanks for all your help in setting this all up for my wife and I, the whole trip was outstanding from start to finish.\n\nThanks,\nHarold K.\nBennett, Co.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a title=\"Start Me Up\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\">Book your Maui fishing charter\nwith Start Me Up Charters<\/a><\/strong><\/p>",

				"<span style=\"color: #252525;\">Ceviche is traditionally made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices, such as lemon or lime, and spiced with <\/span><i style=\"color: #252525;\"><a style=\"color: #0b0080;\" title=\"Capsicum baccatum\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum_baccatum\">ají<\/a><\/i><span style=\"color: #252525;\"> or chili peppers. Note that the citrus COOKS the fish. You will not be eating 'raw' fish. <\/span>\n\nThere many variations on the basic ceviche recipe. Almost any firm white fish or shrimp can be used, though I prefer making it with ono (wahoo). The firmness of the fish stands up well to the cirus juice without becoming mushy like mahi often does, but can still be considered delicate compared to shrimp or scallops.\n\nI've seen variations that used fresh oregano or tarragon, course black pepper and cucumber slices, instead of hot red pepper and tomato. I suppose it's your personal tastes, how you plan to serve it, and with what and to whom.\n\n<strong>Ingredients:<\/strong><ul><li>2 lb. fresh ono (wahoo)<\/li><li>1 tsp hot red pepper, finely diced\nHawaiian chili pepper. Thai chili pepper works well. Both very hot. Wash hands thoroughly\nafter handling!!  If you go with a milder pepper then increase the amount.<\/li><li>1/2 cup of chopped green onion (incl. bulbs), or\n1/2 cup thinly sliced chopped sweet Kula, or red onion<\/li><li>1 cup seeded/chopped fresh Roma tomatoes (optional)<\/li><li>MARINADE:\n1/2 cup of lemon juice\n1/2 cup of lime juice\n2 teaspoons of sea salt\n1-2 tbsp. coconut milk (optional)<\/li><\/ul>\nCut 2lb. of ono fillets (no skin/bones) into 1/2 inch pieces and put them in a glass bowl/container. I find that a large mayonaise/pickle jar works well.\n\nAdd pepper, onion and tomatoes.\n\nPour the marinade over the fish mix and toss gently to blend.\n\nCover and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. Longer or shorter depending on the size/firmness of the fish.\n\nRemember that the fish is 'cooking'  in the citric acids and the longer you leave it in the marinade the more 'cooked' the fish will be. Leave it too long and it will be overcooked. I leave the jar on it's side and turn it a 1/4-1/2 turn every 15 minutes. When all of the fish pieces have just turned bright white, I drain the liquid off even if I'm not quite ready to serve it.\n\nOno Ceviche can be served on it's own or as a salad topper. Avocado goes well with it.",

For fishermen in Hawaii, however, August signals another thing altogether - the Lanai Rendezvous Fishing Tournament.\n\nGoing strong in its 43rd year, the tournament is by invite-only, with first priority given to those who have competed previously. A long-running tradition for many experienced fishermen from across the state of Hawaii, the tournament begins at 12:01am on a Friday morning and ends with a weigh-in on Saturday afternoon. While monetary prizes are given for the winners, the tournament is more about celebrating tradition and catching up with fellow local fishermen.\n\nDuring last year's tournament, the crew from the <a title=\"Marjorie Ann\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/marjorie-ann\" target=\"_blank\">Marjorie Ann<\/a> won the biggest fish jackpot for their 355 pound Blue Marlin catch, and along with the rest of the competitors, celebrated with an overnight camping trip at Lanai's Manele Bay.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2491 size-full\" title=\"Marjorie Ann - Lanai Rendezvous\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mauifuncharters1.jpg\" alt=\"lanai rendezvous and big game fishing maui\" width=\"580\" height=\"409\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2467\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bottomfishingmaui.jpg\" alt=\"fishing maui hawaii\" width=\"275\" height=\"375\" />While not technically a sportfishing boat, The crew of the Marjorie Ann obviously has the skill set to do well the in the world of competitive sport fishing in Hawaii. Offering daily bottom fishing tours, Maui Fun Charters has definitely made a name for itself among fishing enthusiasts on Maui.\n\nAlso in August, they have been reporting lots of snapper catches while trevally is expected to increase as October approaches. Since bottom fishing is generally more consistent than sportfishing, this is a great way to see the island, get out on the water and enjoy a day of fun in the sun with the possibility of dinner for friends and family. With a current maximum guest count of six people, they are working hard to push that number closer to ten. While the process comes with its fair share of rigorous Coast Guard tests, this would open up the possibility for more guests to experience bottom fishing on their next Maui adventure.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2468\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fishingmaui.jpg\" alt=\"sport fishing charters maui\" width=\"580\" height=\"392\" />\n\nMaui Fun Charters also recently announced that they have the equipment to begin offering private specialty charters for deep ocean fishing off the Maui coast. Using electric fishing gear that can work in up to 2,000 feet of water, the benefit of this type of fishing is the ability to catch larger and more fish, minus the muscle soreness. This custom fishing charter is weather dependent and cannot be guaranteed. We suggest people book a 4 hour private and state that they are willing to extend to the 5-hour deep ocean bottom fishing trip if conditions warrant. We're looking forward to trying this ourselves!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2470 size-full\" title=\"Maui Fun Charters: light tackle fishing\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sportfishingmaui.jpg\" alt=\"light tackle fishing maui\" width=\"580\" height=\"524\" />\n\nFor more information, contact us or call <span style=\"color: #000000;\">1-808-344-3520. Mahalo for reading, and happy fishing! <\/span>",

				"So, your Maui fishing charter was a success. Whether that fish was a record breaker, or simply the largest or most beautiful thing you ever landed, you earned bragging rights!  On Maui, you have three options available to you: Mounts, Prints, or Photos.\n<h3>Fish Mounts / Taxidermy<\/h3><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2561\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ahi.jpg\" alt=\"ahi tuna fish mount\" width=\"601\" height=\"259\" />\n\nIn Hawaii, fish aren't \"stuffed\" anymore. Virtually every captain I know uses fiberglass fish replicas rather than traditional skin mounts. Unlike stuffed skin mounts, a fiberglass replica won't deteriorate over time. You won't have to face that ugly skin shrinkage, or grease bleed that is so common with saltwater fish. These replicas will literally last a lifetime and are incredibly lifelike. Also, by ordering a replica fish mount, you can promote catch-and-release fishing.\n\nIf you're interested in obtaining a trophy mount please discuss this with your crew as you head out on your fishing charter. They'll walk you through the process, discuss costs, timelines and expectations.\n<h3>Gyotaku / Japanese Fish Printing<\/h3><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2563\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mahi-crawford2.jpg\" alt=\"mahi-crawford2\" width=\"600\" height=\"289\" /><strong>Gyotaku<\/strong> is the ancient Oriental art of printing on either cloth or rice paper using an actual fish for the imprint. There are a couple of artists on Maui who do this exceptionally well. Brian Heustis, owner of <a href=\"http://mauifishprinting.com\"><strong>Maui Fish Printing<\/strong><\/a>, works regularly with a number of vessels here. Mention their name to your captain, they can help you with all the arrangements. The benefits of Gyotaku over traditional fish mounting are speed of delivery, the price. My personal opinion is they're also more attractive as an artform, but that's totally subjective!\n<h3>Fish Pictures<\/h3>\nOK, this is sort of a no-brainer. You did bring your camera, right? But let's look beyond the obligatory proud angler on the dock. If at all possible, go for the art shot; one you can blow up to 20\" x 30\" and proudly showcase on your wall.  Fish pictures as art should be taken moments after bringing the fish on board the boat, because after that the brilliant colors start to fade.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2565\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mahi-closeup.jpg\" alt=\"mahi-closeup\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><h3>Fish for Dinner!<\/h3><em>READ: <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/keeping-the-fish/.\">Keeping Your Catch<\/a><\/em><!--\n<strong>PHOTO CONTEST!!<\/strong> Did you get an awesome art shot of your Maui fishing experience? Send me a copy, along with any or all of the following info and be entered to win your choice of gyotaku fish print pictured on this page!

This well-maintained, 41' Hatteras features a spacious, open design allowing ample room for up to 6 anglers.\n\nThe #1 goal of this owner-operated charter company (aside from catching fish of course) is to share the Aloha Spirit and to treat their clients a great day of sport fishing. From owner, to captain, to crew, the Hinatea Sport Fishing's team treats every guest with dignity and respect.\n\nTheir obvious passion for the art of Hawaiian fishing is infectious. The format for each day is simple: <strong>“Don’t wait for the fish to bite to start having fun!”<\/strong>  With an attitude like that, guests are bound to feel they received good value, regardless of the whether they catch the big fish of the day!\n\nWith her elegant lines and clean wake, the Hinatea has sometimes been described as a “<strong>fish magnet.<\/strong>” Mahi mahi, ono, ahi, billfish like marlin and spearfish are the most common pelagic species caught off Maui Hawaii. If you're fishing nearer to shore you might also catch uku, ulua, amberjack, barracuda, shark and more. Guests will be invited to take home a portion of the day's catch (up to about 25 pounds), which the crew will gladly filet for you at day's end.\n\nThe crew are always experimenting with new lineups and patterns to ensure success. Anything to put a bend in the rod! Hinatea Sport Fishing fishes with artificial lures, live bait, dead bait; whatever the captain feels will work best in any given situation.\n<h5>Hinatea Features<\/h5><ul><li>Tuna tower<\/li><li>Outriggers and downrigger<\/li><li>Live baitwell<\/li><li>Tournament quality gear (20lb spinning tackle through all classes of line)<\/li><li>Penn Internationals, Shimano Reels, Fen-nor 80 wides<\/li><li>Galley with fridge<\/li><li>Comfortable head (marine toilet)<\/li><li>Spacious, open cockpit<\/li><li>Fighting chair<\/li><li>GPS, fish finder and stereo<\/li><li>Wide, flat aft for a consistently smooth ride<\/li><\/ul><table style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid #000; padding-left: 4px;\"><tbody><tr><th style=\"text-align: left;\">Trip Length<\/th><th style=\"text-align: left;\">Privates<\/th><th style=\"text-align: left;\">Shares (4-6 anglers)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 hr<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">$850.00<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">n/a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">6 hr<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">$1,000.00<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">$190.00 pp*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">8 hr<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">$1,100.00<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">$210.00 pp*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">10 hr<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">$1,300.00<\/td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">n/a<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><em>Rates do not include 4.167% state GET, 3% harbor fee, or gratuity.\n<\/em><em><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;\">* 50% discount for riders (non-fishermen).

				"Lili,\n\nI wanted to give you some feedback on the <a title=\"Reel Luckey\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/reel-luckey\">Reel Luckey<\/a>.  We had a tremendous morning of fishing in late October.  Captain Tad was superbly skilled and clearly knew all the spots.  His downrigger style of fishing is apparently unique in Hawaii and produced every one of our 5 hookups that day.  The top water trolling rigs (what everybody else uses) saw no action that day.  The boathand Brian was very knowledgeable and personable and had the lines in the water.  He clearly had a passion for fishing himself and <a title=\"Shore fishing guides\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/other-fishing/shorefishing/shorefishing-guides\">guided shore fishing trips<\/a> when he wasn't on the Reel Luckey.\n\nI've attached a few pics.  We boated two, 8-10lb Grey Snapper and released a large shark.  Had 2 other hook ups that were lost. Jigging for bait was awesome and the fishing with live bait (only a fraction of captains know the best places to go for the live mackerel... or so I've been told) seemed to be key on the dowrigger line.\n\nBrian and Tad generously offered us all the fish to take home for ourselves.  We accepted 1 snapper and grilled it that night.  Best fish any of us had ever tasted.\n\nThanks again for hooking us up with such a tremendous boat.  Please forward this to Tad and Cindy.\n\nSincerely,\nBrian <span class=\"il\">Petersen<\/span>, Charlie Toillion and Andy Southwick\n\n[envira-gallery id=\"2713\"]",

				"The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui\" target=\"_blank\">Maui<\/a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-game_fishing\" target=\"_blank\">fishing charters<\/a> industry experiences ebbs and flows, with new fishing opportunities emerging, and other Maui fishing charter companies cruising towards the horizon in search of new adventures. Below is my current take on the state of deep sea sport fishing in Maui Hawaii for 2015. Bear in mind this list is subjective. Not everyone's idea of the perfect Maui fishing charter is the same. Catch rates fluctuate from year to year. Captains and crews move from boat to boat. Contact me and I'll suggest the best Maui fishing charter for you!\n\n<a href=\"/reservations/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2803\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bookyourcharter2.png\" alt=\"bookyourcharter2\" width=\"500\" height=\"194\" /><\/a><h3>Best Maui fishing charters<\/h3><h5>Best value for private sport fishing charters:<\/h5><strong><a title=\"Hinatea Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/hinatea\">HINATEA SPORTFISHING<\/a><\/strong>\nAt $1,100.00 for an 8 hour Maui fishing charter, <strong>Hinatea Sportfishing<\/strong> is a superb value. This 41' Hatteras is one of the more comfortable and spacious sport fishing boats on Maui. A typical 8 hour sport fishing charter n Maui usually runs round $1200.00.\n\nHinatea is fully outfitted for tournament level sport fishing, with a tuna tower, roomy salon, spacious deck, and of course top of the line equipment. Some people have suggested that the Hatteras design itself is a factor in her success; Fish apparently are attracted to the wake she generates – a sort of pied piper effect. Personally, I feel most of the credit lies with her hard working crew. They use live bait, dead bait, artificial lures. They'll often fish with a downrigger, lighter tackle and live bait bringing in fish like ulua, uku, amberjack, barracuda.  In short, they work hard to put a bend in your rod. Most importantly, day after day, the Hinatea team shares the 'Aloha Spirit'. For these reasons they are currently <strong>#1 on my list for private Maui fishing charters<\/strong>.\n\n<strong><a title=\"Action Sport Fishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/action\">ACTION SPORTFISHING<\/a><\/strong>If you're the adventurous sort, the <strong>Action<\/strong> is another excellent value for private Maui fishing charters. Action's private rates are only $1,099.00 for NINE hours.  Their shared charters are reasonably priced too at only $209.00 per angler, but if the boat fills all six seats, this 35' Blackfin can feel a little cramped. The Action departs daily at 0230hrs (yes, 2:30 in the morning) from West Maui's Lahaina harbor. They'll head farther offshore where the water may be rougher. It's definitely not a charter for everyone. But in leaving early, the Action can reach some of the more desirable fishing spots before first light, and be in the ideal position for multiple hookups of mahi mahi, ono and ahi tuna, which happen more frequently at dawn.\n<h5><a href=\"/reservations/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2803 size-full\" title=\"Book your Maui sportfishing charter\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bookyourcharter2.png\" alt=\"Book your Maui sportfishing charter\" width=\"500\" height=\"194\" /><\/a><strong>Best value for shared charters<\/strong><\/h5><a title=\"Luckey Strike II\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/luckeystrike\"><strong>LUCKEY STRIKE CHARTERS<\/strong><\/a>\nThe Luckey Strike II is another excellent choice for a shared Maui sportfishing charter. This spacious, 50' Delta will not feel crowded with 6 anglers on board (the maximum number of anglers they'll take on  shared trip, though they may take additional riders along at a reduced rate). The crew are friendly and skilled. The gear is well maintained. The only drawback of Luckey Strike II is that you may get \"bumped\" should a private charter come along before they can reach the minimum 4 people, OR they simply may not reach the minimum, in which case the boat wont go. This is standard policy with boats that offer shared sportfishing.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\">START ME UP SPORTIFISHING<\/a><\/strong>\nStart Me Up Sportfishing boasts the largest fleet of chartered fishing boats on Maui. They are your best choice for last minute charter openings. Boats include Start Me Up, Start Me Up Too, La Dat, Das It, Jun Ken Po, Cuz, and Action. Cuz and Action are specialty boats, while the others operate the company's 4, 6 &amp; 8 hour private and shared trolling trips. Other than Cuz (a 42' Dorado) and Action (35' Blackfin) all their boats are Bertrams, 38' - 42'. All well outfitted. All well maintained.\n\nStart Me Up Sportfishing, as a rule, does not \"bump\" share boat anglers for private charters, unless they don't reach their minimum of 4 anglers, and this doesn't happen very often. If you can only fish on a certain day and don't want to risk getting \"bumped\", the Start Me Up is your best choice.\n\n<a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/finestkind\"><strong>FINEST KIND SPORTFISHING<\/strong><\/a>\nThe three sportfishing boats owned and operated by <strong>Finest Kind Sportfishing<\/strong> – <a title=\"Finest Kind\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/finestkind\"><strong>Finest Kind<\/strong><\/a>, <a title=\"Reel Hooker\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/reel-hooker\"><strong>Reel Hooker<\/strong><\/a> and <strong>Exact<\/strong> – have been fishing off Maui for years and all have solid reputations. They've kept their costs down particularly low on their 4 and 6 hour shared trips (6 hour shared charter is only $175.00 per person) making them a solid buy when chartering for 1-4 anglers. And while they will not guarantee which boat you'll be on for a shared trip, they do try and limit the number of anglers to allow for a more personalized experience; No guarantees there won't be six though!\n\n<a href=\"/reservations/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2803 size-full\" title=\"Book your Maui fishing charters\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bookyourcharter2.png\" alt=\"Book your Maui fishing charters\" width=\"500\" height=\"194\" /><\/a><h3><strong>Maui's top catch boats<\/strong><\/h3><strong>Which boats catch the most gamefish off Maui Hawaii?\n<\/strong>The deepsea sport fishing boats with regularly overflowing fish boxes are often those that leave in the middle of the night, and are able to reach locations farther offshore just before dawn. While no Maui fishing charter can be guaranteed (fishing is fishing after all) anglers booking these deepsea fishing charters when the bite is on usually return to Lahaina harbor TIRED.\n\nMy two favorite early morning departures are <a title=\"Die Hard\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/diehard\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Die Hard Sportfishing<\/strong><\/a>, the <a title=\"Action Sport Fishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/action\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Action Sportfishing<\/strong><\/a>. One caveat: these Maui fishing charters are not for the feint of heart. Action and Die Hard often stay out longer and fish rougher water in search of fish. Seasickness is pretty common so take <a title=\"What if I get seasick?\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/question/seasickness\" target=\"_blank\">precautions<\/a>.\n\n<strong>Which Maui sportfishing boats catch the BIGGEST fish?<\/strong>\nThis changes from year to year. A captain might get lucky one year and bring in a grander. The following year there may be only a handful over 300lbs. The <strong>Jun Ken Po<\/strong>, operated by <strong><a title=\"Start Me Up Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\" target=\"_blank\">Start Me Up Sportfishing<\/a><\/strong> brought in a 1058lb. blue marlin as recently as June 4th of this year.\n\nMaui sport fishing boats including <strong>Hinatea<\/strong>, <strong>Finest Kind Charters, Luckey Strike,<\/strong> and others in the <strong>Start Me Up <\/strong>fleet, have all had respectable marlin counts. The captains on <strong>Piper<\/strong> and <strong>Rascal<\/strong> out of Maalaea harbor are also skilled marlin hunters and should not be overlooked for a chance at the big ones!\n\n<a href=\"/reservations/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2803 size-full\" title=\"Book your Maui fishing charters\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bookyourcharter2.png\" alt=\"Maui fishing charters\" width=\"500\" height=\"194\" /><\/a><strong>Maui fishing charters for groups of 7 or more. <\/strong>\nI sometimes get calls from clients who have arrived on Maui with a group of 8-10 people hoping to enjoy a leisurely day of fishing on Maui (weddings mostly, sometimes Maui family reunions). Newsflash: If you've waited until you get to Maui to make these plans chances are you're too late.\n\nThere are only 3 charter boats that will focus on fishing which are licensed to carry more than 6 passengers. One focuses on sportfishing charters (<a title=\"Luckey Strike II\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/luckeystrike\"><strong>Luckey Strike II<\/strong><\/a>), one on bottom fishing (<a title=\"Hokua\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/hokua\"><strong>Hokua<\/strong><\/a>) and the third (<a title=\"Strike Zone\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/strikezone\"><strong>Strike Zone<\/strong><\/a>) is a bit of a chameleon, offering \"combo\" trips which can lean in any direction upon request.\n\nOut of the three <strong>Luckey Strike II<\/strong> takes the lead for sport fishing. As of this writing, an 8 hour trip on Luckey Strike II costs roughly half that of Strike Zone for a party of 8. Combine that with their crew's fishing skill and the owners' friendly flexible, easy-going attitudes it's no wonder that Luckey Strike has a very high repeat customer rate.\n\nAs your guest count increases however, Strike Zone begins to look more attractive. Their crew is skilled at managing groups of over 2o, their vessel well outfitted, and they include a light snack.\n\nNot to be outdone, <strong>Hokua<\/strong> is a hidden gem. They are one of the few fishing boats licensed to put people in the water, so a charter combining a bit of light fishing and a bit of snorkeling is possible.\n\n<strong>Best 1/2 day Maui sport fishing charters<\/strong>\nLuckey Strike's sister ship, the <a title=\"Reel Luckey\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/reel-luckey\"><strong>Reel Luckey,<\/strong><\/a> is my choice for top Maui sportfishing trip under 8 hours. Logic dictates that the longer you fish for the better your odds. But Reel Luckey bucks the odds by focusing on gamefish in shallower waters. They've no need to drive farther offshore so run only 4, 5 &amp; 6 hour fishing charters. Using live bait caught at the start of a charter, Reel Luckey trolls in select spots along the Lahaina coast. They target mahi mahi and ono on the surface, while simultaneously running a downrigger as much as 150 below the surface to bring in travally, amberjack, rainbow runner, barracuda, and shark. ... You never know what's gonna bite down there! Private charters only.\n\n<strong>The luxurious sportfishing yachts of Ma'alaea, Maui.\n<\/strong>For those staying down south in Kihei, Wailea or Makena Maui, your most convenient fishing options will be the boats out of Maalaea harbor. There are three dedicated sport fishing boats running charters from here, but only <a title=\"Rascal Charters\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/rascal\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rascal Charters<\/strong><\/a> offers shared sportfishing trips. Captain Kevin Hogan is a seasoned sportfishing veteran and has been operating the <strong>Rascal<\/strong> now since the late-nineties. Supply and demand suggests you book Rascal well in advance!\n\nWhile the Rascal is certainly a lovely 42' Bertram, complete with AC cabin, and a full complement of professional gear, the other two boats out of Maalaea are definitely higher end yachts. The 48' Cabo <a title=\"Piper\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/piper\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Piper<\/strong><\/a> and the 52' Buddy Davis <strong><a title=\"Excellence\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/excellence\" target=\"_blank\">Excellence<\/a> <\/strong>cater to Maui's most elite clientele.  In terms of service and style, these two are only surpassed by one other Maui sport fishing boat: the <a title=\"Jayhawk\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/jayhawk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jayhawk<\/strong><\/a> out of Lahaina harbor which will run you a cool $700.00 per hour plus taxes and fees. Bell's 'n Whistles aside, all of the captains operating these Maui fishing charters have an equal chance of hooking up to gamefish for you.\n\nWhen booking your Maui fishing charters you will be asked to provide a credit card number to hold the reservation. In most cases your card is not charged until the day of the charter. You will have between 48-72 hours to cancel without penalty.",

				"<em>First Published by Donnel A. Tate, Lahaina News.<\/em>\n\nLAHAINA - The blue marlin bite was pretty slow from January through February. There were only six blue marlin weighed in January, with the first big blue showing up for the New Year.\n\nNew Year's Day had an almost 500-pound marlin weighed, with the <a title=\"Hinatea Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/hinatea\"><strong>Hinatea<\/strong><\/a> starting off 2014 with a 499.6-pound blue by the father and son team of Jeff and Taylor Schoenekase. They were fishing with Captains Neil Preston and Chris Wong.\n\nThere were only three blue marlin weighed and one released in February.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2809\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"262\"]<img class=\" wp-image-2809\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/biggest-marlin-maui.14.jpg\" alt=\"Biggest Marlin caught on Maui in 2014: 684.9 lbs.\" width=\"262\" height=\"448\" /> Biggest marlin caught on Maui in 2014: 684.9 lbs. Photo copyright Donnell Tate.[/caption]\n\nThe blue marlin bite slowly picked up for the first part of March. The big blue marlin finally showed up for the final two weeks, with two in the 600-pound range (684.9, 634.8) and four in the 400-pound range (491.5, 470.1, 410.3, 400.2). This was the best month for blue marlin over 400 pounds.\n\nThere were a total of 14 blue marlin weighed and another three released.\n\nThe <a title=\"Hinatea Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/hinatea\"><strong>Hinatea<\/strong><\/a> landed a nice catch for wahine angler Audry Morris during March weighing 400.2 pounds. She was fishing with Capt. Chris Wong and deckman Peter Wong. This was the largest blue marlin by a wahine angler for the year.\n\nApril was the second best month for big blue marlin, with two 600-pounders (669.4, 600.7), two 500-pounders (568.4, 533.2) and one 400-pounder (407.7) weighed. There were a total of 12 blues weighed and another two released.\n\nA black marlin also made the lineup - the first one in 12 years. The <a title=\"Start Me Up Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\"><strong>Start Me Up Too<\/strong><\/a> landed a very rare catch for Maui waters and Hawaii, weighing a 161.0-pound black marlin by Harold Kenyon. He was fishing with Capt. Denny Putnam and deckman Ross Elkins.\n\nThe last black marlin caught by the Lahaina Harbor Sportfishing fleet was in May 2002, with a 101-pounder aboard the <a title=\"Hinatea Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/hinatea-sportfishing/.\"><strong>Hinatea<\/strong><\/a>. The largest black marlin for the harbor is a 559.5-pound fish by Capt. Dave Rockett aboard the Halcyon. This was also the winning fish in the first Lahaina Jackpot Fishing Tournament held in 1977. There have only been 19 black marlin verified and documented since 1977 out of Lahaina.\n\nThe <a title=\"Action Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/action-sportfishing/.\"><strong>Action<\/strong><\/a> joined the 500-pound marlin club in April with a 568.4-pound blue by Josh Padley and Kevin Phillips. They were fishing with Captains Randy Evans and Johnny Keiley.\n\nJust four days after weighing a 684.9-pound marlin, the<a title=\"Start Me Up Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\"><strong>Jun Ken Po<\/strong><\/a> came in with a 533.2-pound blue by 16-year-old Caleb Henry. He was fishing with Capt. Gabriel Rogers and deckman Dyllon Smith. This is the largest blue marlin caught by the youngest angler and 12th largest for the year.\n\nThe March/April big blue totals were four 600-pounders (684.9, 669.4, 634.8 and 600.7, the four top blue marlin for the year), two 500-pounders (568.4, 533.2) and five 400-pounders totaling 11 fish. The two-month blue total was 26 weighed and five released for a total of 31 fish.\n\nThe top blue marlin for the year was a 684.9-pound fish by Gene McReynolds. He was fishing with Capt. Gabriel Rogers and deckmen Brandon Maxwell and Dyllon Smith on <a title=\"Start Me Up Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\"><strong>Jun Ken Po<\/strong><\/a>.\n\nThe <a title=\"Start Me Up Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\"><strong>Start Me Up Again<\/strong><\/a> made the 600-pound club with a 669.4-pound blue by David Dang and Seth Willer. They were fishing with Capt. Jason Duby and deckman Rob Cosgrove.\n\nThe <a title=\"Cuz\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/cuz\"><strong>Start Me Up Cuz<\/strong><\/a> weighed a 634.8-pound blue by Rodney Schwagel. He was fishing with Capt. Craig Schuler and deckman John French.\n\nAnd the <a title=\"Start Me Up Sportfishing\" href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\"><strong>Start Me Up Again<\/strong><\/a> placed another blue into the 600-pound club - this one just making the cut at 600.7 pounds.

				"<em>Hunter Allen and his son fished with the <strong><a href=\"/hinatea\">Hinatea<\/a><\/strong> in May, 2015. <\/em>\n\nAmazing, incredible, record-setting day that we'll NEVER forget with Greg and Jason aboard the Hinatea!!  Can't say enough about how easy-going these guys were in welcoming my 11 year-old son and me onto their boat for 6 hours and working their asses off to ensure a great catch and a great time...\n\nI should also say that Lili at FishMaui, and Doug - the owner of the Hinatea - were incredibly easy to work with and extremely accommodating in shifting their schedules around to ensure they could have the right boat and the right people available to take us out.\n\nWhen we got to the dock at 5:30 AM they were ready to go with a clean boat and big smiles, and began immediately to teach us all about their wonderful craft.  By 6:00 we were already trolling and by 7:00 my son had already landed his first fish -- a beautiful, 49\" MahiMahi, which is already headed for my son's wall.  Then we headed for the deeper water, and NOTHING could have prepared us for what came next!\n\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"4\" ids=\"2927,2926,2928,3087\"]\n\nAround 10:00, we got another hit while I was up top.  Jason and Greg had my son strapped into the chair in a flash, and over the next 50 minutes they scrambled around offering encouragement, instructions and assistance where possible as my son fought a big fish.  Watching them get it into and onto the boat was something I'll never forget.  The end result may very well have been a RECORD for an 11 year-old angler: AN 11'8\", 503 LB BLUE MARLIN!!!  Do I need to say more??  The best thing was that Greg and Jason were every bit as happy and excited as we were!\n\nNot sure what else to say, except that these guys are experts at their craft, work hard to make sure you have a great time, and I absolutely give them my highest possible recommendation.  Thank you, and good luck!\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsw5hdaWqQc&feature=youtu.be[/embed]\n\n<a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/hinatea\">MORE ABOUT HINATEA<\/a>",

				"<h3>How much does it cost to charter a fishing boat on Maui, Hawaii?<\/h3><strong>There are 3 main criteria effecting the cost of a Maui fishing charter:<\/strong><ol><li>The type of fishing charter you book (private or share boat)<\/li><li>The length of a charter (4 hours, up to 10 hours)<\/li><li>Boat characteristics (size, bells 'n whistles, operating costs, etc.)<\/li><\/ol><h4>Shared fishing charter rates<\/h4><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2966\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lighter-tackle-fishing-maui-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"lighter tackle fishing, maalaea maui\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />If you plan to <strong>share a charter<\/strong> – that's when you pay a per person rate and share the boat with others who are unknown to you – expect to pay anywhere from $154 per angler on the lowest end (<a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/strikezone\">Strike Zone<\/a>'s 4 hour bottom fishing charter, including tax), up to $299 per angler on the high end for an 8 hour sport fishing charter. Not all boats offer shared charters.\n\nMost rates you'll see online are before Hawaii GET (4.166%), harbor fees (3%), or gratuity.  A few charter companies allow riders to come along at a reduced rate.\n\nPersonally, I don't feel a shared 4 hour sport fishing trip is much of a bargain. Many Maui sport fishing boats don't even offer 4 hour shared charters. An individual angler's personal catch odds on 4 hour sport fishing trip are simply too low. Complaint rates too high.  That's not saying you WONT catch anything, only that the <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/catch-odds/.\">odds<\/a> are against it. If you only have 4 hours to spend, and you don't want to spring for a private charter, I recommend bottom fishing.\n<h4>Private fishing charter prices<\/h4><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-3656\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/striped-marlin-junkenpo-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"private fishing charter\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />While certainly more expensive, the exclusive nature of a <strong>private sport fishing charter<\/strong> is definitely superior to the shared charter. The captain and crew can cater specifically to your group's expectations, rather than trying to satisfy others who may not have the same goals as you.\n\nBooking a private fishing charter on Maui  – that means only you and your friends/family will be on board, along with captain and crew – will cost from $799.00 on the low end (<a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing/bottom-fishing-boats/cuz\">CUZ<\/a>'s 4 hour bottom fishing trips, and <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing/sportfishing-boats/start-me-up\">Start Me Up<\/a>'s 4 hour sport fishing trips), to well over $6,000 for a full day aboard the luxurious <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/satisfaction\">Satisfaction<\/a>. Extremes aside, the average cost for a private fishing charter on Maui is more like $900 for 4 hours, $1250 for 6 hours, and $1,600 for 8 hours. These prices do not include 7.166% state GE tax and harbor fees.\n<h4>Tipping your crew<\/h4>\nA gratuity for your charter's crew is customary on Maui. Think of it like tipping at a restaurant: anywhere from 10-20%. The amount of the tip should be based on how friendly and accommodating your crew was, and of course, how much effort they put out trying to get fish for you!  Remember, your crew arrived at the boat before you did to set things up, and they will be there long after you leave, cleaning the boat and equipment, organizing tackle for the next day, and dealing with restaurants who may be purchasing a portion of the day's catch. 10-12 hour days are the norm for most.\n<h4>Is it worth it?<\/h4>\nFor many anglers, YES!! Especially if you embark on your Maui fishing charter with the right attitude. First and foremost, plan on enjoying a day on the ocean in paradise. Take in the sunrise. Reconnect with family and friends. <em>Talk story<\/em> with the crew, or others on board with you as you wait for the 'big one' to strike. Turn off your phone and be in the moment. If you're lucky you'll return to the dock with a fish story or two, plenty of fresh fish for the BBQ, and memories that will remain with you for years to come.\n\n<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>This post was updated for accuracy on May 17, 2020<\/em><\/span>",

				"Here on Maui, the subject of keeping the fish you catch comes up again and again, year after year. I'd really like to put the matter to bed, once and for all. So here goes...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3164\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mahi-filet-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"mahi filet for dinner\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /><h4>Can I keep the fish we catch?<\/h4><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing\"><strong>BOTTOM FISHING<\/strong><\/a>\nMost bottom fishing boats on Maui allow you to keep whatever fish you catch (unless they plan on using it as bait). The captain/crew will let you know which are tasty and safe to eat. Most bottomfish here are relatively small - under 3 pounds. We don't have halibut on Maui, and the grouper we do have are frequent carriers of the marine toxin <i><a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/malamalama/2009/06/peacock-grouper-not-for-consumption-in-hawaii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ciguatera<\/a><\/i>, so are not eaten.\n\n<a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing\"><strong>SPORT FISHING<\/strong><\/a>\nIn Hawaii, anything caught while sport fishing is the property of the charter company (the commercial permit holder) to distribute as they feel appropriate. There are only a couple of sport fishing charter companies on Maui with policies stating that you can keep whatever fish you catch (<a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact-2\">contact me if you're interested in those<\/a>). Others will filet a portion of the day's catch for their clients. How much a given captain provides will depend on the quality/quantity of the fish caught that day and the boat's specific – often unwritten – policy. Any marketable fish they don't cut up will usually be sold whole to local restaurants. Ahi over 100 lbs will most likely not be cut.\n\nMost captains prefer 'catch 'n release' billfish like blue marlin. Only billfish which are unlikely to survive the fight will be boated for photo opportunities and smoked for the meat. If you're lucky enough to hook a marlin on your Maui fishing charter, and you are hoping for photos, be sure to ask the crew if it is possible to get a picture of you alongside the fish as it's brought to the side of the boat!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Will the boats give us enough fish for a dinner or two?<\/h4><strong>Absolutely<\/strong>! With few exceptions, the charter companies I work with will be happy to fillet – at no charge – a portion of the day's catch for you to enjoy while you're on island.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Are there restaurants that will prepare our fish for us?<\/h4>\nA few, yes, but none that will allow me to put that in writing! Speak with the captain that day. They'll have some suggestions for you if you don't have access to a stove or BBQ here on Maui.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>I want to ship the fish I catch home. Can I do that?<\/h4>\nMaui is not Cabo, or Alaska, or Florida. We don't have any canneries, or shipping services specific to perishable fish, so if you do end up with a cooler full of mahimahi on your lanai it'll be your responsibility to pack, and ship. The boats do not get involved. My advice: don't waste your valuable vacation time trying to hunt down dry ice, gel packs and airline regulations. Enjoy your fish FRESH!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact-2\">QUESTIONS?<\/a><\/p>\n&nbsp;",

				"The second most common question I hear from prospective clients starts with <em> <\/em><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">“Can I sportfish if...”<\/span><em>(for the record, the first most common question relates to Maui's fish policy – what happens to the fish you catch –but that's <strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/keeping-the-fish/.\">another post<\/a><\/strong>). <\/em>So I'm going to take a stab at addressing some of the more common concerns people have. If I haven't covered your question, feel free to <strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact-2\">reach out<\/a><\/strong>.\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3171\" style=\"margin-top: 15px;\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sportfishing-recommended.png\" alt=\"is sport fishing recommended\" width=\"279\" height=\"273\" /><h4>I've never sport fished before, will the crew teach me?<\/h4>\nRest assured, the captain and crew are very comfortable talking beginners through their first time reeling in a large gamefish. In fact, the majority of clients FishMaui works with have never sportfished before. You will not be expected to help with baiting/setting lines, gaffing, etc. The crew does that. You pull back and reel, pull back and reel, taking up slack whenever you can. On some charters you might be invited to catch some live bait on the way out. They'll show you how to do that too.\n<h4>What's the minimum age allowed on a sport fishing charter?<\/h4>\nWhile there is some variation from boat to boat, most trolling boats prefer not to take kids under the age of 10 sport fishing. Please read my article on <strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/fishing-with-kids/\">Maui fishing with kids<\/a><\/strong>.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3163\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/joan-reel-286x300.jpg\" alt=\"seniors and maui fishing charters\" width=\"286\" height=\"300\" /><h4>How old is “too old” to sport fish?<\/h4>\nIf you don't suffer from back problems or balance issues, then you'll probably be just fine. I took my 92 year old step-father out a few weeks back and he managed to land a nice uku despite his grumbling about the early hour. But he's spent the better part of 75 years on the water, owns his own boat, and is in remarkable physical shape for a man his age. Just bear in mind that seas can pick up quickly and without warning, so it's important for each individual to make an honest assessment of their own abilities and limitations BEFORE you book a sport fishing charter on Maui.\n<h4>Can women sport fish?<\/h4>\nAbsolutely!! You don't need 15' biceps to reel in a 400lb marlin.  The key is form, feel, and patience. Lots of patience. The crew will be right beside you, talking you through the moves, encouraging you as you gain on the fish, reminding you to reel when you're suddenly struck dumb at the sight of a huge fish breaking water waaaay too far away from the boat. In fact, women often make <em>better<\/em> first time offshore anglers than men. It's simple...\n<ul><li>Women listen more.<\/li><li>They're often more patient.<\/li><li>They don't try to out-muscle the fish.<\/li><\/ul><h4>I'm pregnant. Can I go sport fishing? Or maybe just watch?<\/h4>\nA fishing charter is not recommended for pregnant women. A charter captain probably wont allow it if they're made aware of your condition. The risks are simply too high. Weather conditions can change on a dime out here, and even a 50' boat will rock and roll. Decks can get slippery. Seasickness is commonly reported. My advice: Drop your partner off at the boat in the morning, and take a leisurely sunrise walk on the beach. Cherish the solitude.\n<h4>Can you accommodate a wheelchair?<\/h4>\nLahaina and Ma'alaea harbor are not wheelchair accessible. Unless the client can be safely lifted from dock to deck, then it's probably not going to happen. Even if we are able to find a captain willing to take out a wheelchair-bound client, there are other considerations: the head (marine toilet), usually located a few steps below decks down through a narrow passageway, is not accessible. Unpredictable weather conditions can make for an unsafe ride, even if your wheelchair is lashed to the boat.\n<h4>How about other physical handicaps?<\/h4>\nShort answer, yes. I have had anglers who were blind, deaf, and missing limbs. As always, each individual needs to make an honest assessment of their own abilities and limitations. I also recommend booking a sport fishing charter privately for a more personalized fishing experience.\n<h4>What if I get seasick?<\/h4>\nYou might. If you're unsure, take precautions.

				"<strong>Your Maui fishing charter is not guaranteed.<\/strong><a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/bottomfishing\">Bottom fishing<\/a> does have slightly better catch odds than <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/maui-sport-fishing\">sport fishing<\/a>, but even on bottom fishing trips you might not catch a single fish. Fishing is fishing, after all. It is beyond my (or the captain's) control, and no discounts will be given if you don't catch a fish.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3356\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/battle_a_marlin.gif\" alt=\"Marlin catch odds\" width=\"192\" height=\"232\" /><h4 style=\"margin-top: 15px;\">Your odds of catching<\/h4>\nWhile the following statement is by no means scientific, over the years we've come up with a pretty good \"guestimate:\"\n\nA <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">sport fishing<\/span> boat's catch odds are roughly 10% for every hour spent on the water, up to about 85%. This means that no matter how hard you try, no matter how good the captain, or tricked out the gear, a boat gets \"skunked\" as much as 15% of the time. This is for the BOAT catching, not the individual angler. Catch odds are a bit better for those boats that leave at 2:00am and fish for 8+ hours, but even they come back with an empty fish box now and again.\n\nA <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bottom fishing<\/span> boat's catch odds are higher (but the fish are usually smaller). The majority of anglers catch something on a 4 hour bottom fishing trip, but there are still slow days when no one catches.\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 15px;\">Increasing the odds<\/h4><ul><li>Fish for the longest amount of time possible.<\/li><li>Choose a private charter over a share. This gives you more lines in the water with your name on them!<\/li><li>Choose a boat that has an array of well maintained gear, and an experienced captain. <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact-2\"><strong>Ask me<\/strong><\/a>.<\/li><li>Bring your lucky charms (and leave bananas at home).<\/li><\/ul><h4>Where can I find Maui catch reports?<\/h4>\nThere are no official, published catch reports on Maui. While boats are required to report their catches to NMFS, these aren't published online. A few sport fishing boats have facebook pages, and will upload photos every now and again, but not with any regularity. <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/contact-2\"><strong>Contact me<\/strong><\/a>. I'll set you up with respected boat.\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 15px;\">How to enjoy your fishing charter (even if the bite's off)<\/h4>\nPut your cell phone away.\n\nWatch the sunrise.\n\nYou're fishing in one of the most beautiful areas of the world. Enjoy it!\n\nReconnect with family/friends\n\nEnjoy the stories of <em>new<\/em> friends.\n\nPractice Aloha.\n\nLanding a big fish is the icing on the cake!",

If you’ve caught ahi on your fishing trip, I highly recommend enjoying some fresh caught sashimi that same day. If you’ve got kitchen access, even better, because this sauce (in my opinion) really brings the meal together. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The mild flavour and firm texture of the ahi steak works so well with the slightly spicy/slightly salty butter sauce. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Soy Wasabi Butter Sauce<\/strong> (makes about 1.5 cups)<\/span><\/p><ul><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 Tbs. ginger, crushed<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 tsp. shallots<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4 oz. white wine<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 tsp. lime juice<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2 oz. heavy cream<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/4 lb. unsalted butter<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3 Tbs. sweet Thai chili sauce<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/2 oz. wasabi paste<\/span><\/li><li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3 oz. shoyu (soy sauce or tamari work as well, though shoyu is my personal preference) <\/span><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"p1\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">To make the sauce:<\/span><\/span><\/em><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sauté shallots in a lightly oiled saucepan (I like to use grapeseed oil for this, but anything will do, really), add the white wine and lime juice, then reduce by half. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once the wine mixture has reduced, add the heavy cream and reduce again by 1/3. Whip the butter into your reduction and strain. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stir in the chili sauce, then mix shoyu and wasabi paste together and whip into butter sauce until sauce turns light brown. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taste test your sauce! If you want more salt, add in a bit more shoyu; if you want more spice, add in a bit more chill sauce! If you want to get fancy, you can garnish with black sesame seeds and chives <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3264 aligncenter\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ahisesamecrust-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Ahisesamecrust\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The ahi will only take 2-3 minutes to prepare, so make sure your sauce is ready to serve before you break out the fish. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once your sauce is finished, lightly (<i>very <\/i>lightly) grease a cast iron skillet (or a non-stick skillet, though cast iron will give a better sear) and heat your pan on medium-high. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the pan is heating you can crust your ahi in toasted sesame seeds and a dusting of sea salt and black pepper, or ditch the sesame seeds and just use the salt and pepper. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After your fish is crusted and salted, place it into the skillet and sear. Give each side a quick sear, depending on your taste preferences, just be sure not to overcook the ahi! <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once all the sides have been cooked, remove it from heat and slice to desired thickness - I like to aim for just under 3/4 of a cm or 1/4 inch. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Serve with a light drizzling of sauce on top, and another dish of sauce on the side for dipping.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Leave a review if you decide to make this recipe, and if you caught your ahi on Maui, make sure to let us know who took you out!<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Aloha!<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Credit for this sauce goes to Chef D.K.

				"<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3343\" style=\"background: none;\" src=\"https://fishmaui.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/alarm.gif\" alt=\"alarm\" width=\"288\" height=\"237\" />I write this on December 30. Christmas Week. One of Maui's busiest weeks of the year.\n\nMaybe it's the holidays, but this week alone, I've had two groups arrive late to the dock, one couple \"miss the boat\" entirely, and another arrive to the dock a day early. While the latter only suffered minor embarrassment (and now feels more prepared because he knows where to go), the one that failed to show up was unfortunately charged the full amount of the trip as per the boat's cancellation policy. They couldn't even rebook because all the subsequent trips were full.\n\nHere's how to avoid racing around at the last minute...\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">THE DAY BEFORE YOUR CHARTER<\/h3><strong>Check your confirmation.<\/strong> This should have been emailed to you when you booked your fishing charter. If you don't have it, send an email to \"reservations@fishmaui.com\" and request that it be resent (this of course only applies to readers who booked through FishMaui.com). Read your confirmation all the way through. There's loads of info there. At the top of the email you should find a phone number for the fishing boat. We suggest you phone the boat and double check that everything is on schedule. Reconfirm departure time, etc.\n\n<strong>Do you know where you'll be going?<\/strong>  Most charters leave from either Lahaina or Maalaea harbor. The addresses below are the closest street addresses near the harbors which you can use for your GPS. Do a distance/drive time check on your smartphone or laptop. Don't have one? Ask the boat for driving directions when you call to reconfirm.\n\nRemember to pad your time to allow for parking! Add an extra 5-10 minutes for Maalaea harbor parking, 10-15 minutes for Lahaina.\n<div style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">[one-third-first]<strong>Lahaina Harbor<\/strong>\n675 Wharf Street, Lahaina HI[/one-third-first][one-third]<strong>Maalaea Harbor<\/strong>\n303 Maalaea Road, Wailuku HI\n<span style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\">(Check map. Don't follow road signs to Wailuku!!)<\/span>[/one-third][one-third]<strong>Mala Wharf<\/strong>\n71 Ala Moana St, Lahaina, HI\n<span style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\">(Keep right as you exit off Front Street)<\/span>[/one-third]<\/div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><\/div><div style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">[clear]<\/div>\nCheck your email confirmation for the slip number and boat location within the harbor. If you're confused. Call FishMaui. We're easier to reach than most of the boats. If you call in the morning and get voicemail, LEAVE A MESSAGE. It's likely we heard the call and just weren't able to get out of bed before the second ring. :-) We'll call you back if we can help.\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">PACKING &amp; PREPAREDNESS<\/h3><strong>Afraid of getting seasick? <\/strong>If you've never been on the ocean before, or if you're at all concerned about seasickness, then taking an anti nausea medication in advance of your charter is probably a good idea. If you didn't get a prescription for the Scopolamine Patch from your doctor, then the over-the-counter product called <strong>Bonine<\/strong>® is your next best choice. You can find this at most Maui ABC Stores, Whaler's General Store, etc.. Anti nausea medications wont do you any good if you wait to take when you start to feel sick. Best advice is to take one after dinner, the night before your charter, and another just BEFORE you board the boat.\n<em>READ: <a href=\"http://fishmaui.com/avoiding-seasickness/.\">Avoiding seasickness on your fishing charter<\/a>.<\/em><strong>Food &amp; beverages:<\/strong> The night before your fishing charter, make sandwiches, pack up snacks, water, juice, ginger ale, etc. (no glass containers, and no bananas). Boats supply a cooler with ice for guests to use on board. If you plan on bringing beer, stock up the day before. Maui doesn't allow alcohol to be sold in markets between 11pm - 6am. Anglers departing from Maalaea harbor after 6:15am might consider pre-ordering sandwiches from the <a href=\"http://www.maalaeageneralstore.com\">Maalaea General Store<\/a>. They open at 6:00am daily. They also have decent coffee and hot breakfast items, so if you have enough time you might want to grab breakfast here. Note: they can be busy at 6:00am so allow enough time for this.\n\n<strong>Payment:<\/strong> A few of the boats bill credit cards in advance of the charter. Most collect payment on board. Others collect at the time of booking. Details should be on your email confirmation. Be sure and bring an appropriate credit card if payment is to be collected on board. All charter boats accept cash, Mastercard or Visa as payment. A few boats accept American Express and Discover.\n\n<strong>Tips:<\/strong> It is customary to tip the the crew at the end of a charter. 15-20% is the industry standard – sort of like a restaurant. The captain/crew will split whatever you give them 50/50 so don't worry about tipping each of them individually.\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">THE NIGHT BEFORE<\/h3>\nAvoid heavy drinking. Don't overdo it on the rich foods.\n\nPlan on getting to bed at a reasonable hour.\n\nSet out clothes: shorts, t-shirt, sweatshirt or light jacket (you'll probably take this off around 7am). Slippers / sneakers. Most boats will allow you to go barefoot once on board the boat.\n\nPack a hat – preferably one that wont blow off – sunglasses and sunscreen. Avoid spray-on and oil based sunscreens. These can discolor the decks of the boats. Lotions only please.\n\nA towel is a good idea. Sometimes there's sea spray. Plus, it can make for comfortable seat padding on boat seats that don't have cushions. The crew appreciates this too. It keeps the sunscreen off seats/cushions.\n\nCharge your phone/camera.\n\nPrep the coffee machine so all you have to do is turn it on in the morning. Unless you're on one of our luxury charters, the boats do not supply coffee.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Set your alarm.<\/span> Set your partner's alarm. Is there a radio alarm clock in your unit? Set that too! Arrange for the hotel to call you. There are no refunds if you oversleep!\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">THE MORNING OF YOUR CHARTER<\/h3>\nSplash some water on your face. Pre-apply sunscreen (do not forget the tops of your feet). Have a light breakfast like toast, yogurt, a small bowl of cereal, etc., grab your bag, remember your phone, camera, food, sunscreen, wallet, lucky hat.\n\nHAVE FUN!!",

I've always been the type of person who feels uneasy when looking at how large the sea actually is and I'd like to face those fears soon for the sake of being able to experience something quite unique amidst how mundane my life has been recently. Hopefully, I get to appreciate the picturesque scenery a lot when I go on this trip and have a better appreciation of nature as well.",
