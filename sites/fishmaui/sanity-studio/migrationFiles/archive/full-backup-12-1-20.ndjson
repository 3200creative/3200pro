We had 6 people on the 8 hour charter and everyone caught one but one.  Not bad odds 5 out of 6.  They allowed us to clear the lines and put lines back out and even rigged outriggers.  Many times we are told by other charters to sit and wait for the line to release....there was excitement and lots of activity.

They told us up front that the fishing had been slow but we went out with great hopes.  They mean it when they say be ready to fish and come early!  The boat ride was long but the sunrise over Maui and the breath taking views off Molokai\\'s coast were worth it!  I have been on other charters and hunting trips and know that sometimes its just not going to happen and its no fault of the Captain and crew.  The morning started promising with lots of birds skimming the water.  We hooked up early with a small Mahi Mahi but then fished for hours without success.  When we started heading home we certainly were feeling down but not out. Had the day ended there I would still give these guys five stars because they really tried.  The boat is great and they Captain and crew were really nice and you can tell they know how to fish.  Now the rest of the story!  About a half an hour into the ride back it happened, a monster marlin lit up one of our poles.  This trip was for my son so he got the chair.  We saw this huge fish come out of the water a couple of times.  I still have goose bumps about it.  The fish took out 800 yards of line and then the battle began!  My son battled the fish for almost an hour and when we thought we were close the unfortunate happened and the fish threw the hook.  Though we all were disappointed I could not have been more thrilled to watch that fight.  The estimate was between 4 and 600 pounds!  I saw it and can believe it.  I am a catch and release type of fisherman so part of me is happy the fish will be out there to give someone else a thrill. On the other hand it would would have been nice to get a picture!  All in all was a great day.  Thanks Jeremy and Sam!  This is a memory my son and I will have for the rest of our lives!"}]}],"boatReviewed":{"_ref":"6c74f407-92d6-4a24-9462-9d0d9de839ab","_type":"reference"},"email":"germanrd@juno.com","rating":"5","reviewerName":"Chris","title":"I really like these guys!","tripType":"Fishing"}

Then its the doldrums until afternoon bite which starts around 3:30 pm.  Whether its bottom fishing, trolling for Ahi, live baiting, whatever, this for me holds true.

The rest of the Lahaina fishing fleet landed only one fish that morning. Captain Tad and Garrett use tactics and tackle that give them (and their clients) a distinct advantage over other boats. When we return to Maui we will definitely book this trip again!\r\n\r\nThank you for putting out such a great website with detailed info on each charter company/boat.

Landing an Ono (Wahoo) is now crossed off my \\'bucket list\\'. Went out this morning with Captain Johnny and deckhand Pono on a share boat after spending a couple of hours scratching up live bait (not an easy task today, and something that very few other charter boat captains even bother with) we ran hard to a Fish Attracting  Device that Captain John had chosen to be at just as dawn was breaking. That is one of the advantagesof this trip, the ability to be the first boat to the widest selection of FADs or wherever Johnny believes his clients will have the best probability of catching fish. We started with dead baits in order to beat the trigger fish that would try to steal those. Wits once the sun was up a little higher. The Mahi (Dorado) were there and began hitting the baits that were presented but not taking the hook, just the baits. Johnny switched to the live baits we had worked so hard collect earlier and we began to get hookups and bring Mahi to the boat. He then had Pono mix dead baits back in and our hookup rate continued to improve. After landing 10 or so Mahi one of the group boated a small Ahi Yellow Fin. Johnny again switched it up and had Pono replace the bait hooks with skirted lures and we continued to hook and land fish. When the bite slowed a little bit he changed up again to the Kelp Patty special, a 5 1/2 \" silver and pink lure that one of the other captains in fleet has also had success with. Had not been in the water more than a minute or two when it was slammed by an Ono that sawed right through the 80 lb. leader on the strike. Never willing to give into the fish Johnny had Pono dig out the other lure of the same type and rig it to the line on one of the 50s and out it went. Only to meet the same fate a minute or two later. This time I actually saw the Ono come out of the water on the strike and thought he just slammed it and missed. Until I realized that the line on that rod was, once again, just line in the water with no lure. Now it was game on and Johnny had Pono switch to a couple of bent butt 80s with much heavier high speed skirted trolling lures. Meanwhile one of the 50s still out hooked up and the guy in front of me in the rotation landed one of the bigger Mahi caught this morning. It was not long until one of the 80s went off. This time the Ono was not able to saw all the way through the leader on the strike and after stripping a fair amount of line I was able to bring the fish to the boat. Johnny came down from the fly ridge and together he and Pono made certain that I could cross \\'catching an Ono\\' off my fishing bucket list. \r\nI have fished with Captain Johnny since he was a deck hand years ago. And I have always enjoyed his intense desire to catch fish, even on those rare trips where it is more fishing than catching. And suffice it to say that I will continue to fish with John every time I come to Maui until I am no longer able to crank a reel.\r\nIf you want to take the sport fishing trip on Maui with the highest probability of catching, the 2:30 am 9 hr trip on the Action with Captain Johnny is your best possible choice."}]}],"boatReviewed":{"_ref":"7b774135-0c19-4ba1-be5e-a6071c65b619","_type":"reference"},"email":"Jehutchings@icloud.com'","rating":"5","reviewerName":"John Hutchings","title":"Scratch one off the bucket list","tripType":"Share boat"}

The snapper  was served whole, slightly crispy on the outside on a bed of vegetables in a wonderful sauce. The pa\\'paa was also served 2 different ways ... encrusted in macadamia nuts and also sautéed in a light fennel broth.
