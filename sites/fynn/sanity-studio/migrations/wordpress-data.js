Simply put, we place a hand on the puppy’s croup (chest) area and push it towards the floor; as a result, the puppy will sit. There are a few problems associated with this method. If you’re trying to make a big and heavy dog, such as an English Mastiff, to sit through the use of force, the chances of success are slim. Besides, he’s not actually learning how to sit on command; he’s simply reacting to the push.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"p1"} -->\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Capturing</strong>, on the other hand, can be a much more effective way to teach the puppy. When using this technique, we simply wait for the puppy to voluntarily offer the desired behaviour, we mark it and then offer him a reward. With enough repetition, the puppy will start to present that particular behaviour more often; when we’re pretty sure he’ll sit, we can say the verbal cue and as soon as he sits, we mark the behaviour and reward him.

Your feet are now bathing on a pool of dog pee. What a joyful way to start the day, isn’t it? And just wait until you get to the kitchen… there’s a Mount Everest of dog poop laying on your favorite carpet. Well, if your dog was housetrained, this wouldn’t have happened. Potty training a dog can be tiring, it’s true! It requires patience and persistence.

So, to prevent this, he must be confined to a small space, <em>at first</em>. </span><span class="s1">Since dogs will naturally avoid eliminating next to their sleeping and eating areas, they’ll try to hold it for a bit longer.

Punishing a dog for eliminating on the wrong spot will probably teach him that we can’t trust you and, as a consequence, you’ll end up with a dog that goes behind the couch.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"p3"} -->\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My fourth tip is that <strong>when you find an accident, you must correctly clean it</strong>. Don’t use bleach or any detergent containing ammoniac. It will only enhance the scent of urine. Try to use an enzymatic cleaner that destroys the odour molecules. I personally recommend Nature\'s Miracle, it really is a miracle worker. If you don\'t use a special cleaner like this, your dog will still be able to smell the odour and will continue to pee in that same spot. Also, unlike some other cleaners, Natures Miracle is not toxic, bonus!</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":72,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/9N-83481-68254K-dog.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-72"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/9N-83481-68254K-dog.jpg" alt="natures_miracle" class="wp-image-72"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"p3"} -->\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Potty training a dog requires patience, since it won’t happen overnight. If your dog has been pooping all around the house for five years, you won’t be able to teach him in five days. Remember: reward your dog every time he gets it right and don’t punish him when he gets it wrong (if you catch him in the act, try to make a loud noise in order to interrupt him and take him to the appropriate place straight away).</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

However, a Boston Terrier is still a dog! He will need to be trained and educated if we wish him to become a balanced and well-adapted member of our human family. As any other breed, Boston Terriers can (and should) be trained by using science-based and positive methods. However, their particular temperament can influence the choices we make when it comes to training and educating them, since they are very smart dogs!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center"} -->\n<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Hopefully this article can help you in <a href="https://www.TrainPetDog.com/h/lindsayhogg/Boston-Terrier/about-boston-terrier.html">Boston Terrier Training</a></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":176,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bigstock-Turned-Head-396119.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-176"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bigstock-Turned-Head-396119.jpg" alt="boston_terrier_puppy" class="wp-image-176"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"p3"} -->\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Boston Terriers are energetic and outgoing. Although they will happily take a nap on the couch while you watch your favorite TV series, they’re always ready for a walk. Hence, you should offer them the opportunity to leave the house and see new things, new environments and new people. By taking them for a walk every day, they’re allowed to do so whilst exercising at the same time. This is important for their well-being! If your Boston Terrier doesn’t get the chance to exercise, he may start to develop some behavioral problems, such as excessive barking. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"p3"} -->\n<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Excessive barking</strong> is a potential problem within this breed. As Terriers, they’re always alert and ready to protect their house and family, which makes them prone to barking. To prevent this, they can be taught to bark and to be quiet on cue. Simply put, add the verbal cue “Speak!” just before the dog barks and as soon as he does so, we offer him a reward. We repeat this process until we’re sure he understands the meaning of the cue. Then, we’ll add the “Silence!” cue. When he’s barking, we add the cue and we reward him for being quiet, if he stops barking. The idea is to allow the dog to bark in a controlled way and, at the same time, to make sure he’ll be quiet when we ask him to. We know Boston Terriers are likely to bark whenever a stranger passes by; we shouldn’t punish them for it!

The breed came into being back in the day when dog fights were legal and very much the norm, with selective breeding conducted amidst a terrier and a bulldog. The Boston Terrier is recognized popularly by the markings of their coat, which resemble a tuxedo – the reason why they’re also commonly referred to as the “American Gentleman”, the only thing missing is a bowtie! The Boston Terrier is a family pet now due to it\'s wonderful personality. There are a number of reasons <a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terriers/boston-terriers-great-pets/">why Boston Terriers make great pets</a>, but like any breed, Boston Terrier skin problems can arise.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3><strong>The General Personality of Boston Terriers</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Boston Terrier itself is rather minute in size, its sturdy body certainly helps maintain the image, warning other dogs not to mess with them. As with most other breeds, the females tend to be a bit smaller in size as compared to the males.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Boston Terriers are not vicious or fighters until or unless the situation calls for it. You might see your Boston lashing out when it is intimidated by other dogs, or when someone tries to harm their owner – yes, they are known to be rather possessive about their owners. With that aside, a Boston Terrier is the most gentle and loving of its kind, and knows exactly how their owner is feeling due to their ability to identify and feel emotions accurately.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Boston Terrier Skin Problems</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Terrier skin problems aren\'t anymore common than any other dog.

Although it is a rather weird sight, because the skin from the ears down to the neck will be hairless, it is considered to be normal in females.

While excess of these things do generally upset the sensitive tummies of Boston terriers, not ALL dogs are necessarily at a risk with the consumption of these foods. Since every Boston terrier is unique, it may have its own share of good and bad food items.

Their characteristics may vary, but they are friendly in general. Unlike many other breeds, they enjoy playing with elderly people and mostly tend to stay indoors, along with their owner. They are also great watchdogs. Here’s everything you need to know about Boston terriers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":332,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-6.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-332"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Early History:</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also referred to as Boston Bull Terrier, Boxwood and Boston Bull; Boston terrier was initially bred in the city of Boston in United States. The breed originated around 1870 when a Boston resident, Robert C. Hooper imported a dog of terrier and bull family lineage from England. He named it as Judge, which is now fondly known as Hooper’s Judge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston terrier was originally interbred with French Bulldogs as a fighting dog. Therefore, it weighed around 20 kg. However, it was later adopted as a non-sporting breed. Its gentle nature earned it the title ‘The American Gentleman’. The standard weight of the breed is around 5-11 kg, depending upon its feed and health conditions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1889, a club was formed in Boston with the name Bull Terrier Club, later renamed as Boston Terrier Club. At that time, the nickname of the breed was ‘Round headed bull and terrier’, owing to its appearance. The American Kennel Club registered the breed in 1893, which makes it the first local breed to get recognition from the registry of purebred dogs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Appearance:</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers are small-sized dogs with erect ears and a short tail. They have a fine smooth coat which may vary in color. It is usually a combination of black, brown, seal or brindle with white patches. Clean it regularly to keep them safe from potential health issues. Male terriers gain a maximum height of 17 inches, whereas female Boston terriers can get up to 16 inches tall.

This is your ultimate guide to Boston Terriers and the reason behind their growing popularity!</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":336,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-7.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-336"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whoever said good things come in small sizes must have been referring to the adorable Boston Terrier, since the statement fits undoubtedly well to the endearing breed. Boston Terriers, widely known as “American Gentlemen”, are miniature dogs who have a better understanding of most feelings, than human beings themselves. They are considerate, kind and very helpful, especially to the elderly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers are often underestimated due to their minute size, and there are a lot of misconceptions regarding the origins of the breed. Muddled up facts tend to confuse dog lovers who wish to bring a Boston Terrier home, because a dog’s temperament is typically judged by its origins. However, this guide will tell you everything you need to know about Boston Terriers:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Derivation of Boston Terriers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most perplexed thing about Boston Terriers is the derivation of the breed. Many people believe that the name of the dog is such because it falls into the category of ‘terriers’. However, the Boston Terrier has more similarities with its bulldog parent than it does with its terrier parent. To set things straight, a Boston Terrier is produced as a result of selective breeding between a white English Terrier and an English Bulldog. ‘Boston’ is present in its name because that is where it was first bred in the late 1800s. This unique breeding was done with the purpose of using the Boston Terrier as a fighting dog, but it is actually a very affectionate and caring dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Temperament of Boston Terriers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Due to the fact that Boston Terrier appears a lot like a small pit-bull, you may assume that the dog has a bad temperament or is somewhat moody and aggressive. However, this is not the case with Boston Terriers. But then again, the temperament of the dog varies and depends entirely on the personality of your little bundle of joy. Boston Terriers are commonly used to assist the elderly, because the dogs make great guard dogs and tend to focus their attention on one person. Moreover, they are known for their stubborn, childlike personalities and training them might be more than a handful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Boston Terriers with Their Owners</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers do an amazing job at reading and being in tune with their owner’s emotions, and if they find their owner in trouble or sad, they will go the extra mile to make their owners happy by adjusting their own behavior – something that is rather perceptible due to their large and highly expressive eyes. Many people believe a Boston Terrier would be loud and obnoxious like most other dogs of the size, but it’s actually the complete opposite. Boston Terriers are calm and reserved and they really do not bark as much as you would expect it to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":337,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-2.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-337"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Appearance of Boston Terriers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Broad, square heads featuring eyes that protrude and coloring that will certainly remind you of a tuxedo, the Boston Terrier is recognizable even from a distance. Boston Terriers also have short muzzles, so it looks a lot like a pit-bull, or a boxer. They have stubby bodies the size of a terrier, but appear more like the bulldog parent. They are normally black and white, but can also be found in brindle and white or seal and white.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Maintenance</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people forgo the option of bringing a pet home due to the high maintenance that each pet requires. However, Boston Terriers make the perfect pets for this reason because they can be groomed in the blink of an eye. Their fur coats tend to be close to the skin, so there’s not a lot of brushing to do, and they shed significantly less in comparison to other dogs. They also make for the perfect dogs to keep in apartments due to their small size and significantly lower upkeep. But Boston Terriers are extremely energetic and require their daily dose of exercise or they become impatient.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Training your Boston Terrier</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Training your Boston Terrier is one of the most difficult things to do, because they don’t do well with orders and commands. They will try to manipulate you by melting you with big expressive eyes, and you will not be able to say no to the little cutie! Of course, you can always use dog treats as a means to train your Boston Terrier, but if they get too used to the treats, they won’t do anything unless you wave it above their heads.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Health Concerns</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Due to selective breeding, and the deformity that creates the Boston Terrier, they are at risk of developing a lot of conditions that are dangerous to their health. Boston Terriers have breathing problems due to the excess of soft tissue they have around or in their airways. If you intend to have your Boston Terrier neutered or spayed, be extremely careful of the anesthesia they are given, because they do not do well in these cases. However, the life expectancy of a healthy Boston Terrier is around 13-15 years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Do Boston Terriers Make Good Pets?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers make great pets for a lot of reasons, but they also have a lot of complications that you must have the time and patience to deal with. They are ideal for people who wish to have a dog that is energetic and loves to play games such as fetching the ball, or even just a companion to take walks with. Due to their large expressive eyes, they are also suitable for people who desire some sort of validation or opinion, because they will understand you and communicate with you through their behavior and their round big eyes. The Boston Terrier is tiny in size but it is a sturdy dog so it won’t be ideal for someone looking for a lapdog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They also have a lot of health issues such as snorting, wheezing, slobbering, drooling, snoring, gassiness and other problems associated with their deformities, so only someone who can really dedicate themselves to their dog should opt for one. The price of a Boston Terrier can range from anywhere between $200 to $1200, depending on the owner and the locality of the Boston Terrier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

While that’s not easy, it is the most fun part of getting a pet! Let’s pick a suitable name for your little bundle of joy!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":360} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-360"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled4-1.png"><br>\n</a>First and foremost, you must comprehend the value and love that you must give to your pet at all times. A pet is as important to their owner as a child to their mother. To be fairly honest, pets are no different than angels. They support you, love you, care for you and are genuinely there for you through thick and thin. A pet, be it a cat or a dog or any other animal, is painfully loyal to their owner regardless of whatever happens – and the owner must return the favor at all times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moving on, when you first bring in a pet into your home, chances are that the tiny and cute little bundle of joy doesn’t have a name. So, as their owner, their caretaker and their parent, it is your duty to name them just as you would name a child – except when it comes to pets, you can name them absolutely <em>anything –</em> which of course, is the fun part.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Naming Your Boston Terrier</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two ways to determine a name for your Boston Terrier: either let it come naturally to you, which should happen effortlessly, or you can go through this guide which is sure to help you immensely. There are over a thousand names that you can find for your Boston Terrier, but there is more to it than picking out just any name that you like. Here are some things to consider when naming your dog:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Terrier’s Personality</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":357,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-3.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-357"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dogs and all other animals are very similar to human beings, meaning that they feel everything that we have the ability to feel. Often times, dog owners prefer to name their pets according to the sort of personality that the dog has. Not only does this bestow you with a lovely bond with the dog, it will also give you a nostalgic walk down memory lane when the dog has grown up and you call them by the name you kept according to the personality they had as a pup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Unique Markings</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":359,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-2.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-359"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people prefer to name their dogs after a unique marking that they find on the fur coat of the dog. Although most Boston Terriers look exactly the same, there are must be something that differentiates your pup from the rest. Your Terrier might have some sort of markings, such as lots of dots. One of the most common names for dogs includes “spotty” or “spot” or “Smokey”, because of the patterns on their fur coat or the color of it. You can get really creative with names when it comes to this!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Physical Traits</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Physical traits can give you a lot of unique names for your Terrier. A lot of people tend to name their dog after their appearance. For instance, if he has floppy ears, you can name him “floppy” or “flop”. Or if he’s a fat pup, you can name him “chubby”. There are over a hundred names that you can probably come up with just by observing your pup’s physique, behavior and personality. You can also name the dog after its temperament, such as “shy” or “fluffy”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Your Favorite Character</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You will be surprised to find how many people name their pets after their favorite cartoon or superhero character. In fact, people actually have named their dogs “Captain America” just because the dog had a tiny “V” marking on their head. Anything you want or like, you can name your dog. But don’t go overboard. Don’t end up naming your dog something like “iPhone”, just kidding. You can name your pet whatever you want to name them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Name Suggestions for Your Boston Terrier</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":358,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled4-1.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled4-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-358"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although we have given you tons of suggestions on how you can think of a unique and special name for your Boston Terrier, here is a list of the most fitting dog names that you can give to your terrier puppy:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Dinky</td><td>Bessie</td><td>Fanny</td><td>Gertie</td></tr><tr><td>Bonsai</td><td>Betsy</td><td>Lola</td><td>Gretchen</td></tr><tr><td>Inch</td><td>Dotty</td><td>Maisie</td><td>Heidi</td></tr><tr><td>Bonbon</td><td>Eleanor</td><td>Margie</td><td>Helga</td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>Maud</td><td>Molly</td><td>Hanna</td></tr><tr><td>Goober</td><td>Poppy</td><td>Rosie</td><td>Ingrid</td></tr><tr><td>Max</td><td>Roz</td><td>Roxy</td><td>Matilda</td></tr><tr><td>Buddy</td><td>Shirley</td><td>Stella</td><td>Minnie</td></tr><tr><td>Jake</td><td>Tootsie</td><td>Zoe</td><td>Wilhemina</td></tr><tr><td>Buster</td><td>Axel</td><td>Fritz</td><td>Angus</td></tr><tr><td>Deuce</td><td>Bugsy</td><td>Guenther</td><td>Duffy</td></tr><tr><td>Dudley</td><td>Eddie</td><td>Hans</td><td>Fergus</td></tr><tr><td>Igor</td><td>Harley</td><td>Hedwig</td><td>Fala</td></tr><tr><td>Jeeves</td><td>Iggy</td><td>Hugo</td><td>Jock</td></tr><tr><td>Maestro</td><td>Jaque</td><td>Klaus</td><td>Laddie</td></tr><tr><td>Oliver</td><td>Rascal</td><td>Ludwig</td><td>Magnus</td></tr><tr><td>Oreo</td><td>Rex</td><td>Otto</td><td>Murphy</td></tr><tr><td>Tux</td><td>Rocco</td><td>Siegfried</td><td>Shamus</td></tr><tr><td>Winston</td><td>Taz</td><td>Wolfgang</td><td>Beatrice</td></tr><tr><td>Allie</td><td>Cleo</td><td>Gabby</td><td>Bridget</td></tr><tr><td>Buttercup</td><td>Kirby</td><td>Maddy</td><td>Dolly</td></tr><tr><td>Cricket</td><td>Louie</td><td>Maxie</td><td>Gracie</td></tr><tr><td>Gidget</td><td>Max</td><td>Millie</td><td>Katie</td></tr><tr><td>Kiki</td><td>Ringo</td><td>Molly</td><td>Maggie</td></tr><tr><td>Lily</td><td>Rudy</td><td>Nellie</td><td>Martha</td></tr><tr><td>Mimi</td><td>Rupert</td><td>Ruby</td><td>Olivia</td></tr><tr><td>Phoebe</td><td>Scooter</td><td>Sadie</td><td>Sophie</td></tr><tr><td>Pixie</td><td>Tango</td><td>Sally</td><td>Adonis</td></tr><tr><td>Princess</td><td>Zeke</td><td>Winnie</td><td>Bam Bam</td></tr><tr><td>Baxter</td><td>Babs</td><td>Maddy</td><td>Bubba</td></tr><tr><td>Benji</td><td>Bella</td><td>Maxie</td><td>Chewy</td></tr><tr><td>Bruno</td><td>Bertie</td><td>Millie</td><td>Cuddles</td></tr><tr><td>Casey</td><td>Bonnie</td><td>Molly</td><td>Gizmo</td></tr><tr><td>Diesel</td><td>Cassie</td><td>Nellie</td><td>Killer</td></tr><tr><td>Finn</td><td>Chloe</td><td>Ruby</td><td>Nibbler</td></tr><tr><td>Gus</td><td>Cookie</td><td>Sadie</td><td>Peanut</td></tr><tr><td>Harry</td><td>Daisy</td><td>Sally</td><td>Romeo</td></tr><tr><td>Izzy</td><td>Gabby</td><td>Winnie</td><td>Bindy</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>Lizzie</td><td>Webster</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jake</td><td>Lucy</td><td>Agnes</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few unique Boston terrier names that you can use for your, dog if you’re confused as to what you should name your dog.

Owners are constantly caught between the choice of whether to buy a collar or a harness for their flat nosed pooch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div id="amzn-assoc-ad-b643e9bd-69ed-4231-a262-a027090f0220"></div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><script async="" src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=b643e9bd-69ed-4231-a262-a027090f0220"></script></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While most ignorant owners settle for a collar taking in the terrier’s small size and temperament, a harness actually comes much more recommended for the training needs of the dog and adapts well to the health concerns and body structure of this adorable breed as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Collar vs. Harness</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Usually, collars and harnesses are made of the same material and perform the synonymous job of attaching the dog to a leash for enhanced trainability and control. However, a general rule that separates the two is that the use of collars is widely discouraged for dogs that are prone to respiratory and trachea problems and a harness is actually promoted for dogs to avoid this health concern.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":376,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-5.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-376"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now where does the Boston terrier stand amidst this?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Respiratory Problems</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As explained previously, <a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-health/boston-terrier-health-issues/">Boston terriers can potentially have respiratory problems</a> due to which tugging and pulling on the collar to control the dog is not advised.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Sensitivity</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additionally, Boston Terriers are highly intelligent dogs, extremely sensitive to your tone of voice and actions. Hence, while training them, you should be extra careful not to be overly assertive, a risk posed by collars, in order to keep the breed motivated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Good Temperament</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, the Boston terrier is a well behaved dog with occasional spikes of playfulness which can be easily monitored with a gentle harness instead of a choking collar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Eye Problems</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lastly, Boston terriers are characterized by their endearing, bulging eyes. As cute as this feature is, it poses certain <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Diagnose-Eye-Problems-in-Boston-Terriers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eye health risks</a> for the breed. To avoid eye problems due to fluid buildup common in Boston terriers, avoid pulling too hard on collars that may cause the dog’s eyes to water up due to discomfort or pain. And since your dog can always plunge forward unexpectedly, there is an imminent risk of it receiving a gripping ‘choke’ by the collar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston terriers are also at a risk of eye bulges caused by blunt trauma or when the facial skin is pulled on too hard. Both these aggravators of an eye bulge can be caused by collars when tugged on too tightly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now let’s elaborate a little more on why collars are the more outdated choice in front of harnesses for small breeds like Boston terriers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Collars</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":378,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-4.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Usually made of leather, cloth or nylon, a collar fits the dog like a necklace. Due to this, all the force that the dog’s body is receiving is accumulated on its neck, causing and exacerbating the ‘choking’ effect. There is always a major safety breach with the use of collars. The next time your dog sprints to chase a cat or lizard, it’s at a threat of receiving a major blow of force on its neck.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Proponents of collars say they keep the collar loosely tied around the dog’s neck due to safety concerns. However, when you’re out on the road, you need to have firm control over the dog in case a car speeds by. A loose collar can always slip off the dog’s neck, causing the dog to escape or possibly get hurt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hence, unless you’re fully trained to use the collar the proper way, avoid endangering your precious pooch with one!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Harness</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":380,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4-3.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-380"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A harness is usually made from nylon, leather or fabric. Unlike collars, a harness goes around the neck of the dog, in front of its shoulders and behind its front legs. Due to this structure, it distributes the pressure evenly around the terrier’s small frame, instead of putting force on its throat. It is due to this reason that harnesses come highly recommended for Boston terriers with respiratory problems. Since the harness goes around the dog’s body, it allows you to firmly control the dog in case it sprints forward, without causing irritation or coughing from tugging and pulling.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->\n<h1>Best harness for Boston terrier</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Declared a much safer option in comparison to collars, let’s see the best dog harness for Boston terriers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EcoBark Maximum Comfort &amp; Control Dog Harness</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":375,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-2.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-375"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":400} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/download.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-400"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An environmental friendly, no choke design harness made from recycled water bottles, this product comes in a variety of colors and sizes. <em><strong>This is my top choice for Boston Terrier harnesses</strong></em>.

Puppies are simply <strong>THE</strong> <strong>CUTEST</strong> beings on the face of the planet. Boston Terrier puppies are even cuter! With their oversized ears, and eyes that they need to grow into. I mean come on seriously how could anyone not want one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, we’re going to assume you’re either actively looking for a Boston Terrier puppy, or you may already have one. The internet has now brought you here to us to give you the puppy training advice that you may desperately need. Welcome to the Boston Terrier training guide!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4>What You Need to Know About Boston Terrier Puppies</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These wonderful little balls of energy should be considered in a similar class as Gremlins (you know that 80’s movie – if you don’t google it once you’re done here). The reason we say Gremlins is because well Boston Terrier puppies are comparable. Like Gremlins, Boston Terrier puppies have rules. Keep them active, a tired puppy is a good puppy. Boston Terriers are a high energy dog so if they don’t have something to do they will destroy EVERYTHING. When they are bored they will entertain themselves by chewing on your favourite shoes, ripping apart your couch, or worse. With that being said don’t hold them accountable, they are puppies remember it’s up to you to keep them on track correctly. You are their guidance so if you don’t want this to be an ongoing behaviour be proactive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terrier puppies need a schedule, get them into a routine so they have structure. Easy ways to do this is to feed them at the same time everyday, this allows them to anticipate their daily routine. Following the structure, you should keep routines with exercise and playtime as well. Make sure it’s enjoyable for yourself also so you’re enticed to continue the schedule. These routines need to happen the same time everyday even weekends. The first year of your puppy’s life is crucial for their advancing years, which will help prevent less hassle with an adult dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>The Beginning</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s very important to note that the first year of a puppy’s life is the most forming years. How you handle their behaviours now will form how your puppy will progress into an adult.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s also very important to not have high expectations. Most people think a puppy can be fully trained in the first 6 – 8 weeks, this is not true. It takes roughly about 5 – 6 months for your puppy to get into the swing of things. There are going to be some challenges, make sure you handle each of them correctly. Remember you’re trying to build a trusting bond, this is important to establish in the early months. Try positive reinforcements instead of negative. Negative reinforcement can destructively affect your puppy’s behaviour and make them act out more. Positive reinforcements help gain trust and obedience from your Boston Terrier puppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5>Positive Reinforcements</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Positive reinforcements are crucial to your puppy’s health and happiness. If your puppy is treat receptive, have all the treats handy. They’ll associate the good behaviours with treats, which will make them want to be on their best behaviour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Your taking your puppy on a walk – and they are trying to escape their collar or &nbsp;have decided they don’t want to walk any more. TREAT – use the treat as a distraction from what they’re doing. The treat will get their attention and follow the command you’re requesting. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It’s bed time and you’re crate training your Boston Terrier puppy – they are refusing to get in their crate, you may have to physically put them in there. Which they aren’t happy about – once you get them in the crate give your puppy a treat. Again, this is a way the puppy will associate their crate as a good thing (even if they went in under protest)</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Bathroom – every time your puppy goes to the washroom outside – TREAT – this will encourage them to do this more often outside then inside. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are some examples of positive reinforcements, there are many forms. The point of positive reinforcements is to get your puppy excited to do it again!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Potty Training</strong></h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Okay so the last thing we want to do is constantly be cleaning up puppy messes. Remind yourself that accidents do happen. When you puppy makes a mess ask yourself if you did everything you could to prevent it. Do not, I mean it DO NOT be aggressive with your puppy about their mess, this will do more harm then good. You do not want your puppy to be scared of going to the bathroom, they won’t notice the difference of outside or inside if you’re yelling at them. Also, unless you specifically see your puppy in the act <strong><em>do not</em></strong> scold them. If you do see them doing the act, firmly say “NO” or “STOP” one-word commands are easy for them to register. This will be effective for other areas of training as well and they will be familiar with their command. With puppy training there are simple tools to help you and your puppy progress to the great outdoors. Make sure you take your puppy out the same door every time, again building the routine. It’s also helpful to note that you should be taking your puppy out several times a day. Boston Terrier puppies are constantly eating as they grow leading, eating means digesting, and the more they digest the more they gotta go, ya know?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

A lot of these technologies have been updated to be less harmful then ever before. That’s not to say there could be a potential problem with you and your pet. There are plenty of variables to consider. Dog’s much like humans are individuals so what may not bother the dog up the street, may affect yours differently. You have to do your part to ensure your pets safety and their comfortability with the wireless options. These can be an excellent training tool to assist your pet to learn their boundaries while at home.

It secures your pets within an area using a shock collar to prevent them from fleeing. Basically, you run an underground wiring system that is digitally connected to a collar around your dogs’ neck. When the dog reaches the specific area that you have set within the yard, it will produce a shock.

These are just a few of the options available to make your job easier when safely securing your precious pup.

This containment system offers geofencing which means no pesky underground wires. You’re offered a portable system with a plastic collar, they also offer different contact sizes for long and short haired dogs. One of the good things about this system is, if your dog leaves the premises by accident, or is called back they won’t be shocked upon re-entry. All of this can also be tracked through your mobile device so no matter where you are or what you’re doing you know what’s going on.

They state that their set up only takes 1 -2 hours to finish and that it’s relatively easy to get started. PetSafe is also a waterproof collar set so you don’t have to worry about any unexpected problems. They use a system with tone or static to correct the dog from wanting to exit the premises. PetSafe is a good combination of restraint and protection without shock qualities’ this providing a fence free, wireless option for your pet. They also have an emergency shut off so the correction stops after 30 seconds. These all being a manageable system for not so tech savvy pet owners.

It does offer an all in one option though, it offers invisible fencing as well a bark collar also. This fully waterproof system which allows your pet to swim and bathe up to 3.3FT without complications. Pet Control HQ allows you to secure your dog with customizable options to keep your dog secure, out of the garden, or any other areas you don’t want them in.

It’s convenient for us as owners but it can also lead to negative affects for your dog. If you already have a fearful, skittish dog this probably isn’t the best containment system for them, it may lead to worse behaviours. Make sure you are always watching your dogs’ reactions when first starting the wireless fence, and even time after. They may start out okay with it but that can change overtime so watch your dog’s behaviour. You are responsible for their overall wellbeing and purchasing a wireless fence is a good start, but you do not want to have a scared, fearful dog either. Overall know your dog and what they can handle. If you purchase a non-shock securement and have one with static or noise, with a dog that is already scared of loud noises. This will also do more harm then good. Always, always, always be mindful of your dogs reactions – you are their safety net, they will look to you for help. &nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

Although dog food comes in various options its hard to decided what is the best for them. It’s important for all their life stages that they get the nutrients they need, but how do we know? Well there are several variables when feeding your dog to ensure optimal health. Asses your dogs needs, as straight forward as it might sound focus on their life stage. Also, avoid foods that say “All Stages” because each life stage needs specific nutrients. For example: if you have a puppy make sure it’s puppy food you’re feeding them. Puppies are very active and grow rapidly for the first year, so puppy food has more of the nutrients they need to keep up with their metabolism and activity. This will help them grow. If you have an elderly dog it is not best to feed them puppy food. Their metabolism is slower, and they aren’t high activity dogs anymore you can’t be giving them more nutrition then they need. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">How Do I Know What’s Best? </span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Boston Terriers are high energy dogs, so they often need to have a food packed with protein. Make sure you asses your Boston’s needs ie: age, weight, metabolism, and activity levels. These factors are essential in how much he should consume. Boston Terriers should consume about 660 calories a day with regular exercise. Avoid free feeding, free feeding can lead to obesity which can cause more breathing problems with your pup. Instead measure their food and split it up over the course of a day giving them time to digest and keep their metabolism going. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;Should I Feed My Boston Wet or Dry Food? </span></span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000;">It’s usually recommended you give your Boston Terrier dry food. Why? Boston’s are known to have particularly bad breath and canned food can make this worse. Boston owners often opt out of purchasing canned food to prevent their dog’s breath from being worse.

It’s important to find a dog that matches your life style. Boston Terrier’s are high energy dogs, which means they need an active home. If you’re more of a laid-back family then maybe reconsider. These wonderful balls of energy will keep you on your toes! </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">What Can I Expect?</span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Boston Terriers are an amazing breed of dog, they are very loyal companions. Boston’s will give you all the love in the world. Boston’s love to run and will be more then happy to play fetch until their feet fall off. Boston Terriers are a high energy breed be sure to always keep them active! With any high energy dog, they will have to get their energy out somehow – and that may energy might be taken out on your couch, or shoes. With their high energy personalities, you have to watch their health, Boston’s are a brachycephalic breed (to put it simply – they’re a smoosh faced dog) which means they almost always are affected by an upper airway obstruction. This is important to focus on, and make sure your Boston, or future Boston take breaks when they are playing. Even if they don’t want to – and trust me – they never want to. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">What Should I Know About Boston’s</span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">We all know these wonderful little balls of energy are absolutely adorable. They have some faults, by faults I mean farts. Boston’s are famously known for their farts, they’re gassy little buggers. So if you love to laugh all the time Boston’s can definitely help with that. Their wrinkles are also part of what makes them to die for (obviously). You need to know that you are required to clean those precious little love flaps. Boston’s can get infections in between their wrinkles so make sure that is something you always keep an eye on. Speaking of eyes, Boston’s can get “cherry eye” which is what happens when their “third eye” (the protective eyelid inside their eye) sometimes turns inside out, causing inflammation. This isn’t a life-threatening issue, but if it goes without being treated it can cause more health issues. Don’t let this sway your interest in getting a Boston Terrier, there are health issues with any breed of dog. As long as you do your research you’ll be fully set for whatever your Boston throws at you. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">After reading all of this it might be a little overwhelming for you but the best things in life are. If you’re able to maintain a lifestyle that compliments your dog everything falls into place afterwards. Make sure they’re active, well feed and just as much love as they give you. Maybe you’re still asking “should I get a Boston Terrier?” The answer should still be yes of course. You know what you need and what you can handle and having a Boston Terrier is a rewarding experience. You’ll be happy you did! </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

They are excellent with children, cats, and other dogs. Boston’s are very loving and affectionate dogs, who love a good run, or walk, they are even content just hanging out. We’ll go over the good, bad, and the ugly of Boston Terriers. You may be thinking what could possibly be “bad or ugly” about Boston’s - trust me these aren’t actually bad or ugly. The good will be the absolute best things about Boston’s, the bad will be normal dog/puppy behaviours, and the ugly will be some of the medical issues you may experience with a Boston Terrier. Don’t panic keep reading and you’ll see what we mean. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">The Good</span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Boston Terriers are genuinely one of the best companions you could possible have. These loving, trusting pups are an amazing asset to any home. If you wanna feel ALLL the love, a Boston Terrier is for you. Definitely. Boston’s are known for their affection, they are literally the perfect lap dog. They’ll love it just as much as you, trust me. Plus, on top of that, in the cooler months it’s like having a mini heater on your lap (this is a huge win if you’re always cold). Boston’s are an interactive dog, meaning they’re interested and want to do exactly what you’re doing. They are the type of dog that will be attached to your hip, wherever you go they will be right there with you. Between their big adoring eyes, their adorable snorts, and their clowning around you will continually fall in love with them, over, and over. Boston’s will win over your heart in no time (as if they haven’t already, lets be honest) and you’ll find the absolute best friend in having one. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">The Bad</span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">What could possibly be bad about this breed? Well like we said before the bad, really isn’t that bad. With proper training “the bad” won’t be an issue at all. With that being said you have to remember dogs do make mistakes. Boston’s are known to be a “high energy” dog, which means you should make sure you make play time, or walks, or fetch, these will help drain their energy. Like many dogs, if they don’t exhaust their energy, they will find something themselves to get their energy out. That means DESTRUCTION…dunn, dunn, dunnnnnn. Basically, they’ll find something to take their energy out on, like a door frame, or rip apart one of their toys, or a sock, or shoes, or anything they can get their pretty little mouths on. It’s important to remind yourself before freaking out, if it could’ve been prevented. Did you forget fetch time? Or a walk? Although it’s easy to see the mess and destruction your pet may have made, was it preventable? And what can you do to prevent it happening again? </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">We may as well get this outta the way also, Boston’s fart. They’re little fart machines, so if you love a good laugh these gassy little babies are right up your alley. Also avoid wet food, this will add to the flatulence and create a gassier little monster.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->\n<h4><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">The Ugly </span></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000;">The ugly, again – its really not that ugly. It’s more like unfortunate circumstances with the breed which is not their fault at all. These little adorable buggers have cute little smooshy faces, and those face are called Brachycephalic. Unfortunately, this causes problems with their breathing. So, when they’re doing extensive running, or playing keep an eye on them. You might have to give them a bit of a time out, even though they won’t want one. When will you know? It’s pretty easy to tell, they’ll be heavily panting, with their cute bulgy eyes popping out. Speaking of their eye’s Boston’s are known for “cherry eye” (there are a few other breeds that get this as well). Cherry eye is when their inner eye lid becomes detached and inflamed. This is not a life-threatening thing, but it should be taken seriously. If it’s left for too long it can cause more issues for your beautiful baby, and who would want that. Boston’s (as well as many small breed dogs) have issues with their legs. This can happen at any age it’s known as luxating patellas or kneecaps. Most cases are mild but in other cases it could potentially need surgery. How does this happen? Well to put it simply, it basically means that their kneecaps can easily slip out of place. It’s not really something that is preventable, but you can make sure they’re not over doing it. So again, during play time, whether it be at the park, with a doggie pal, or even just horsing around, be cautious. While we’re on the topic of health issues, Boston’s are known for skin allergies and anything can cause this. Such as their diet, grass, things within the home, if your Boston is showing signs of skin irritability do the power of elimination. Start with their food, a lot of dog breeds have food allergies and a quick switch of the food goes miles. If it’s not the food, check their bedding it could be a laundry soap, or even a certain type of grass. You might be in panic mode, but these are all very manageable conditions. So no need to panic. &nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">This has been the good and bad of Boston Terriers which doesn’t really seem so bad does it? Are you still wondering “what to know about Boston Terriers?” if you’re anything like me probably, but most of what you needed to know has been right here. As long as you do proper training and save this post, you’re set. Obviously if it’s an emergency head to the vet immediately. Find a good trainer, keep an eye out for certain things and you’re set! Go get that Boston and be loved more then you could possibly imagine. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

This luxury dog collar is personally one of my favourites hands down. It’s jewel incrusted skull and bones gives it an edge above the rest definitely. It’s not suited for smaller dogs – mostly because they don’t offer that size (maybe that’s because the skull is to heavy? Yeah we’ll go with that) they do offer Medium, Large and Extra Large. They have a few colour options available ( not as many as ^ that one above this review – carrying on) six to be exact. The bad boys are hand crafted individually with polished nickel to give them their solid shine. Although the they look pretty but they are not good for rigorous activity or dogs who pull. It’s more of a show not go kinda collar. Probably best used for just around the house to show off how cool your dog is. </span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.bitchnewyork.com/collections/collars/products/diamond-head-designer-dog-collar?aff=15">Click here</a></span> to view more about this collar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3><a href="https://www.bitchnewyork.com/collections/collars/products/sarah-dog-collar-leash?aff=15"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Sarah Dog Collar/Leash</span></a></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"left","id":479,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sarah-dog-collarleash_2400x.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sarah-dog-collarleash_2400x.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-479"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">This adorable collar is very simplistic, and you can purchase a matching leash to go with it as well. Although it offers a wide range of colours and options it does not specify which colour options they have available. So, this leads me to believe its all the wonderful colours of the world, but make sure you ask anyways. You have the option of a two tone for the inside and the outside of the collar. They promise the highest quality and carefully welded clasps to ensure your dogs safety. There are no specific sizes though, but with them stating completely they’re customizable I presume they can make whichever size you want? There’s a lot of unknowns with this collar combo which makes things a little difficult but if you’re interested you can always just ask I guess.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.bitchnewyork.com/collections/collars/products/sarah-dog-collar-leash?aff=15">Click here</a></span> to view more about this collar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3><a href="https://www.bitchnewyork.com/collections/collars/products/dubai-dog-collar-leash?aff=15"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Dubai Dog Collar/Leash&nbsp;</span></a></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":481,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dubai-dog-collarleash_2400x.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dubai-dog-collarleash_2400x.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-481"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">BOW WOW – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boho-chic">Boho</a>?

There are many options available for you to choose from! They also offer two toned collars as well so the options are endless with 20 colour options for inside and out. They offer quality leather for your dogs well being so that’s also a huge plus. Besides the design of this collar combo there really isn’t much that makes it any different from the rest. They offer three sizes for the collar none of which are for smaller sized dogs – but like I’ve said before they claim that they are completely customizable.

There are 8 different colours and size options you can choose from to directly suit you and your dogs’ style. The collars are all around American made – they’re made in Los Angeles and fully claim to be made with American made materials. All of these things describe an all around excellent product. BUT, and it’s a little but – just a little. It doesn’t mention the sturdiness of the clasps and also mentions “Not warrantied or guaranteed over recommended size due to pet safety” so I’ll leave that for you to decide.</span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://www.bitchnewyork.com/collections/collars/products/designer-dog-collar-s07516?aff=15">Click here</a> to view more about this collar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

The clothes look so cute! Now you want to dress your Boston Terrier to look as cute as those social media dogs, but you may not know what size to get them.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Boston-Terrier-On-White-03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-515" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Boston-Terrier-On-White-03.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="487"></a></figure><p></p>\n<p>You know what size you wear, but how do you know what size will fit your dog? It\'s not like you can always take them to the store and have them try everything on in the fitting room.</p>\n<p>Boston Terriers are all a general size, but your dog\'s clothes may fit differently than others. Here\'s how to measure a dog for clothes, Boston Terrier edition!</p>\n<h2>Size Charts</h2>\n<p>There are size charts that you can find online to get a rough estimate of what size you should get for your dog.</p>\n<p>As a general guideline, a lot of people&nbsp;<a href="http://www.puppyweights.com/boston-terrier/52/">go by weight</a>&nbsp;to find the right size that will fit their dog.</p>\n<p>For example, this is a standard weight chart that may help you find a starting point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extra small: 3 to 7 pounds</li>\n<li>Small: 7 to 15 pounds</li>\n<li>Medium: 15 to 25 pounds</li>\n<li>Large: 25 to 35 pounds</li>\n<li>Extra large: 35+ pounds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This can be helpful because obviously a Boston Terrier puppy won\'t weigh the same as an adult dog, which means that they probably both won\'t wear a large.</p>\n<p>There are many size charts you can find online, and most of them list a Boston Terrier as a Large +.&nbsp; There are standard dog size charts, but because Boston Terriers have a wide chest, they may not fit into a large that a regular dog would fit into.</p>\n<p>On average, a Boston Terrier\'s measurements may look similar to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Length: 15"</li>\n<li>Neck: 14 1/2" - 16"</li>\n<li>Girth: 21"-23 1/2"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://fynn-and-friends-store.myshopify.com/collections/all?page=1">Just like people</a>, every dog is different, and what might fit for your neighbor\'s Boston Terrier might not fit on yours.</p>\n<p>It\'s also important to know that just like people\'s clothes, each manufacturer may have a different size or sizing chart. Everyone makes their clothing a little bit different, so check on the website to see if they have a customized sizing chart to help you decide what to buy.</p>\n<h2>How to Measure a Dog for Clothes</h2>\n<p>Now that you have a general guideline of what measurements of your dog will fall under which size, you need to know how to measure a dog for clothes.</p>\n<p>You may have trouble getting them to stand still while you measure them, but rewarding them with a treat after or during can make the process a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Now, go dig the measuring tape you use for your own online clothes shopping and use it to measure your dog. If you don\'t have a measuring tape, you can normally find cheap ones in the weight loss section of a department store or at a fabric store.</p>\n<h3>Neck</h3>\n<p>First, you should wrap it around their neck (but not tight enough that it will choke them). Take off your dog\'s collar before you do this so you make sure that the measurements you\'re getting are accurate.</p>\n<p>Measure the circumference of their neck in inches, and you should be measuring wherever their collar normally rests.</p>\n<p>A good rule is the "two-finger rule." To check for this, make sure you can slip two fingers between the dog and the tape measure.</p>\n<p>Once you have the measurement, write it down so that you don\'t forget it.</p>\n<h3>Rib Cage</h3>\n<p>Next, you want to measure the circumference of your dog\'s rib cage. You will do this by measuring the top of their back (right below their neck) and then under their chest (right behind their front legs).</p>\n<p>Remember that the tape measure should be somewhat tight around their body. However, you don\'t want it too tight to cause them discomfort. Measure as tight as you would want their clothes to fit them. Once you have this measurement, write this one down as well.</p>\n<p>You can use the two-finger rule here as well.</p>\n<h3>Back</h3>\n<p>The third step is to measure all the way from the base of their neck down to where their tail begins. You can do this just on their back.</p>\n<p>If your Boston Terrier is a boy, you may want to subtract these measurements a little more. If you already know what clothes you\'re buying, you should check to see if there is a cut out on the underside for his groin and stomach. because if there isn\'t, he will probably end up peeing all over his new clothes, which won\'t be fun for him or you.</p>\n<p>If he is a boy, subtract two inches from this measurement and write it down as well.</p>\n<h3>Chest</h3>\n<p>Because Boston Terriers are known for having wide chests, this will be one&nbsp;extra step that you may not normally do on other dogs.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is measure the width of their chest, so put the tape measure on their chest in the front, and measure from the left front leg to the right front leg.</p>\n<h2>Compare to Size Chart</h2>\n<p>Once you have your measurements, you can compare them with the references above, or find a chart online or on the website where you\'re purchasing the clothes.</p>\n<p>If you\'re not sure about the measurements and which category your dog would fall into, use the chest measurement as the most important point of reference. And when in doubt, go with the larger size.</p>\n<h2>Find Your Dog Some Cute Clothes</h2>\n<p>Boston Terriers are really active, so finding them some comfortable clothes can keep them warm or dry from the rain and cold as they run around outside.</p>\n<p>Knowing how to measure a dog for clothes is important because especially if you order them online, you want to make sure that they fit your dog comfortably.</p>\n<p>So now that you know what size your cute Boston Terrier is, you can finally pick out some clothes for them.</p>\n<p><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-toys-clothes/best-clothes-boston-terriers/">Start shopping here today</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->',

Let\'s make your pet the best-dressed pooch on the block.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Dog-Looking-At-259780216.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Dog-Looking-At-259780216.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>What\'s the Point of Tiny Dog Clothes?</h2>\n<p>When you see puppies in hats or tiny terriers sporting a cute costume, you may wonder, what\'s the point?</p>\n<p>There are many reasons why you may buy clothes for dogs. Your pet may be a perfectly pampered pooch, and a wardrobe full of dog wear is a must-have for your fashionable fur baby. You may even want to be matchy-matchy with them and wear the same outfit.</p>\n<p>Aside from it being trendy, your pet may need clothes to&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-toys-clothes/dress-boston-terrier-winter/">protect them from bad weather</a>. Especially if they are old, have a short coat or have circulatory problems.</p>\n<p>If your beloved canine has a light colored coat, he may need dog wear that will protect him from the sun.&nbsp;And a doggie raincoat can also keep your pet warm and cozy on those rainy days.</p>\n<p>Whatever your reason is, make sure your pet is comfortable and relaxed. That\'s your first priority!</p>\n<h2>Paw\'some Tips for a Trendy Pooch</h2>\n<p>Even if your four-legged friend is stubborn and picky, you can make dog-wear a success. All it takes is the combination of patience and positive reinforcement.</p>\n<p>These next paw\'some tips will help you on your journey to a pampered pooch.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Gift-11076740.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Gift-11076740.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="780"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h3>Teach an Old Dog New Tricks</h3>\n<p>When you try to&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-training/training-your-boston-terrier/">teach tricks and commands</a>&nbsp;to your pooch, an early start is best. The same applies to clothes for dogs. Teaching them from puppyhood will help them to see that clothes are simply a part of life.</p>\n<p>When your pup is small, that\'s the best time to start sporting dog wear. After they become accustomed to wearing clothes for dogs, they\'ll feel comfy and they won\'t mind wearing them.</p>\n<p>But if you didn\'t teach your Boston Terrier from when they were young, it\'s not too late!</p>\n<p>The old saying is false.&nbsp;<a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2012/09/27/you-can-teach-an-old-dog-new-tricks/45219.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to research</a>, you CAN teach an old dog new tricks. But it might take some extra effort on your part.</p>\n<h3>Fitting Your Fur Baby</h3>\n<p>When purchasing clothes for puppies and older dogs, it\'s vital that the clothing is comfy. If the clothes are too loose, all they will want to do is shake them off. And if the dog wear is too tight, it may even restrict their breathing or movement.</p>\n<p>Before you buy any clothes for dogs, first take your dogs measurements. You will need the measurement around your pups neck, body, and from the back of the neck to the tail base.</p>\n<p>Some dog wear is custom made for certain breeds. Others have specific sizing guidelines to follow. Some clothing is also adjustable, such as jackets and vests.</p>\n<h3>Easy-Wear Clothes for Dogs</h3>\n<p>When trying to put clothes on to your four-legged friend for the first time, things can get ugly. For example, pulling clothing over your dogs head may cause him to panic.</p>\n<p>Instead of frightening the poor fellow, try to select clothing that you don\'t have to pull over their head or that cover their limbs. Find clothing that is easy to put on, such as clothes that fasten around the tummy or chest.</p>\n<p>Once your pup gets used to these easy-to-wear clothes, you can start trying on more complicated pieces. Such as sweaters or shirts.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Dog-In-Winter-J-277280905.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Dog-In-Winter-J-277280905.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h3>Put on Clothes Step-by-Step</h3>\n<p>Whether you\'re trying to dress up an old dog or a new pup, you need to introduce the clothing slowly, but surely.</p>\n<p>Follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The sniff test. Show your dog the clothing and let him sniff and explore it. Reward him with a treat if he shows interest in the clothes.</li>\n<li>Rub the clothing against the side of your pooch. Praise him while doing so.</li>\n<li>Drape the clothing over their back. Reward them if they stay calm.</li>\n<li>Slowly start fastening the clothing straps and keep on praising your pooch.</li>\n<li>Give your pet a chew toy or something to distract him. If you do this quickly, he may not notice he\'s wearing clothes.</li>\n<li>If your pup is cool with the dog wear, give him a treat and reinforce the good behavior.</li>\n<li>After 1-2 minutes, remove the clothing.</li>\n<li>Do the same thing the next day. This time, keep the clothes on a little longer.</li>\n<li>Try to increase by 2-5 minutes each day (depending on how stressed they feel about it).</li>\n<li>Repeat until your pooch gets used to wearing clothes without there being an issue.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your dog starts to become stressed or upset, don\'t give up. Take it back a few notches, start with 30 seconds and try to build up again.</p>\n<p>Start reducing the amount of attention and treats you give them while they are NOT wearing the clothes. They will then start to associate wearing the clothes to getting praised.</p>\n<p>Remember to use your treats and praise in the right way. Reward your pooch as soon as he reacts in a positive way to the clothing. If you give a reward after he has pulled away or tried to take the clothing off, you may be reinforcing negative behavior.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Portrait-Of-Boston-Terrier-Dog-261244807.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Portrait-Of-Boston-Terrier-Dog-261244807.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>The Leader of the Pack</h2>\n<p>Are you ready to dress your&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/everything-need-know-boston-terriers/">Boston Terrier</a>&nbsp;in some stylish dog wear?

You can’t resist picking it up. The truth is, pet clothes are huge at the moment, and it doesn’t have to be Christmas for you to find some for your pooch.</p>\n<p>These clothes aren’t just for looks though. They also serve a function. Just like with a human, there are some things that you have to take into consideration when buying some for your furry friend though.</p>\n<p>To help you out with your clothes shopping for your Boston Terrier, here is everything you need to know about dog clothing.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Dog-Looking-At-259780216.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Dog-Looking-At-259780216.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>1. Why Your Boston Terrier Could Use a Cute Shirt</h2>\n<p>Besides aesthetics, there are actually several ways that doggie clothing can make your Boston Terrier feel more comfortable. Here are a few of these factors.</p>\n<h3>Weather</h3>\n<p>Boston Terriers have short hair. This is fine for the summer months but during the winter, they will freeze a little during their daily walks in the snow. Clothes aren\'t just an extra layer of protection from the harsh snow, it can also shield them in the rain.</p>\n<p>Short haired dogs aren\'t the only ones that benefit from this protection. Some dogs have&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-health/boston-terrier-health-issues/">health conditions</a>, such as Cushing’s, that leave them more vulnerable to the weather.</p>\n<h3>Allergies</h3>\n<p>Putting clothes on your dog will stop them from shedding and spreading their dander all over your home. &nbsp;Not only will it keep it out of the air, but off your furniture as well.</p>\n<p>This will provide a little bit of relief to you or someone else in your home&nbsp;<a href="https://pets.webmd.com/features/pets-allergies#1">who is allergic</a>. You\'ll be able to have anyone you want over without worrying about your guest going into a fit of sneezes.</p>\n<h3>Insects</h3>\n<p>Insects can\'t exactly bite through the cloth of your dog\'s outfit. This is good because some insect bites, like those from wasps and hornets, are life-threatening to smaller breeds like the Boston Terrier.</p>\n<p>Having your dog wear an outfit to the dog park will help them avoid these evil little insects.</p>\n<h3>Age</h3>\n<p>Like humans, when dogs age, they get bone and joint diseases like arthritis. These joint problems can cause them a lot of pain during the cold winter months. Some older dogs actually have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/health-problems-in-senior-dogs-1118543">health conditions</a>&nbsp;which lower their body heat.</p>\n<p>The dog clothes will provide a little extra warmth that will make them cozy and keep any joint pain away.</p>\n<h2>2. How to Pick Out the Perfect Outfit</h2>\n<p>Now that you know why you should pick up a few outfits for your Boston Terrier, you have to figure out the how. How do you pick out the perfect clothes for your furry friend?</p>\n<h3>Practicality</h3>\n<p>While you want to pick out the cutest outfit&nbsp;possible for your dog, it needs to be practical. You can\'t just go to the store and pick out a few cute baby outfits for example. They have to be made for dogs for one.</p>\n<p>The clothes that you get need to be exposed at the stomach and groin area so they can do what you\'re taking them outside to do. You also need to watch out for zippers and loose buttons. These things can be a choking hazard if they get caught on something.</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>The clothes that you pick out for your dog shouldn\'t restrict their movement. Dogs are active creatures who love to play and run, especially when they\'re puppies. If their clothes are too small, they won\'t be able to do move around with ease.</p>\n<p>They should be loose enough so that they can move, but not so baggy that they look silly or are falling off of them. If you\'re getting clothes for a puppy, you may want to buy something that\'s adjustable so they can still wear it when they\'re a bigger Boston Terrier.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boston-Terrier-jpg.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-526" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boston-Terrier-jpg.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="318"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h3>The Fabric</h3>\n<p>Again, your dog is going to want to run around and play even when they\'re a little older. It\'s for this reason that you need to pay attention to the type of fabric their clothes are made out of. You should pick stuff up that\'s made out of stretchy material.</p>\n<p>The best materials for this are cotton or spandex. Stay away from wool, as it can be a hit or miss. It can very well irritate your pooch\'s skin, and it has to be washed by hand.</p>\n<h2>3. Type of Dog\'s Clothes</h2>\n<p>Now you may be asking what type of clothes meet all the requirements that we\'ve listed above? Here are a few different types that are both cute and functional.</p>\n<h3>Lightweight Shirts and Dresses</h3>\n<p>You don\'t want to wear big bulky clothes inside your house, and neither does your dog. Lightweight shirts and dresses are perfect for keeping hair and dander off your things while allowing the dog to be comfortable.</p>\n<p>These are also perfect for the summer because they can protect them from the sun while not being hot and overwhelming.</p>\n<h3>Cooling Vests</h3>\n<p>Even the shortest walks can be a bit too much during the summer when it\'s really hot out. When it comes to these high temperatures, even light clothes will be too much.</p>\n<p>Buying your dog a cooling vest can be the perfect thing to keep them comfortable in these harsh conditions.</p>\n<h3>Warm Sweaters</h3>\n<p>During the fall and winter, you\'ll need to put your Terrier into something a little warmer. You can go with a thick sweater during the winter. For the fall, a Pancho will do, as it\'s not as hot as a sweater but also serves as an extra layer to keep them warm when the wind gets a little brisk.</p>\n<h2>Is Dog Clothing a Good Option for Your Furry Friend?</h2>\n<p>Are you thinking of picking up dog clothes for your furry friend? While they look adorable on them, they\'re also pretty practical. Use this helpful guide for picking out dog clothing to get the perfect outfit for your Boston Terrier.</p>\n<p>Your dog isn\'t the only one who could use new clothes.&nbsp;<a href="https://fynn-and-friends-store.myshopify.com/collections/all/boston-terrier-clothing#MainContent">Browse through our products</a>&nbsp;to find clothes that will help you show off your love for your Boston Terrier.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->',

This will allow you to learn more about these fun-loving animals. If you\'re undecided about picking one up, read this article to help push you over the line.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Dog-Breed-Boston-Terrier-With-283370728.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-532" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Dog-Breed-Boston-Terrier-With-283370728.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>1.&nbsp;America\'s Pioneering Breed</h2>\n<p>One of the most interesting facts about Boston Terriers is that it holds a unique distinction amongst dogs. Although there is evidence of their breeding earlier, they came to be recognized as the first dog breed developed in the United States.</p>\n<p>The American Kennel Club announced in 1893 that the Boston Terrier had become the first recognized as being bred in the USA.</p>\n<p>These dogs are filled with energy that their owners soon come to adore. Initially, they could weigh up to 40 pounds, which is about twice what they usually weigh these days.</p>\n<h2>2. Massachusetts State Dog</h2>\n<p>As a result of their origins in Boston, Massachusetts, Boston Terriers have an unmatched history and connection with the area.</p>\n<p>This led to the breed being named the&nbsp;<a href="https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/massachusetts/state-dog-cat-state-mammal/boston-terrier">official state dog</a>&nbsp;of the Massachusetts state in 1979. Now you can see that the love for the animal is official business in Boston!</p>\n<h2>3. Violent Origins</h2>\n<p>Though you wouldn\'t believe it today, Boston Terriers were initially bred with some seriously bad intentions in mind.</p>\n<p>Dating back to the&nbsp;<a href="https://bostonterriernetwork.com/index.php/category-blog/83-the-history-of-boston-terriers.html">late 19th Century</a>, Boston Terriers were bred for the sole purpose of becoming brutal fighting dogs. Over the decades, numerous breeds came into existence which mixed bulldogs and terriers.</p>\n<p>The intention was to create the ultimate fighting hound. Unfortunately, dog fighting was a common and popular bloodsport amongst the working class of Boston during this period.</p>\n<p>Originally known as Hooper\'s Judge, the Boston Terrier was originally a cross between an English terrier and an English bulldog. Luckily for us, Boston Terriers are no longer forced to fight for survival.</p>\n<p>Despite their history, Boston Terriers can become incredibly obedient dogs if you know how to give them the&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/blog/boston-terrier-training-guide/">right training</a>.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Portrait-Of-A-Dog-Breed-Boston-284147818.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-533" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Portrait-Of-A-Dog-Breed-Boston-284147818.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>4. The Dapper Dogs</h2>\n<p>With a distinct pattern on their coats, Boston Terriers have been known for years as "The America Gentleman". If you look at their unique coats, you\'ll see that they bear a more than a striking resemblance to someone wearing a tuxedo!</p>\n<p>Once you\'ve seen&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dogreference.com/meet-the-american-gentlemen-aka-the-boston-terrier/">the comparison</a>, you\'ll never be able to look at them the same again.</p>\n<p>If you are considering purchasing a Boston Terrier, make sure that you take a trip to a department store. You\'ll be able to find a little premade bow tie for your new pooch.</p>\n<p>This will give you your own little James Bond lookalike. Also, you\'ll become one of the cutest dog owners in your neighborhood.</p>\n<h2>5. C-Sections are Common</h2>\n<p>Boston Terriers have impressively large heads. This is great for owners who like to give their dogs a good pat. Unfortunately, it\'s less good for their mothers.</p>\n<p>Proportionately speaking, Boston Terriers have heads which are larger than their own bodies. This means that it is very difficult for them to be naturally birthed.</p>\n<p>The result is that it is very common for Boston Terriers to be born via a cesarean (also known as a C-section). Any qualified vet will be able to conduct the procedure.</p>\n<h2>6. The Nation\'s Former Favorite</h2>\n<p>At one time, the Boston Terrier was the most popular pet in the entire USA. Statistics supplied by the American Kennel Club highlight that between 1905 and 1935, the Boston Terrier was either the most popular dog in the country, or ranked 2nd.</p>\n<p>Although this number has fallen in the following years, there is little doubt that many people still hold the Boston Terrier close to their hearts. It now sits in the mid-20s in the list of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2015/08/26/how-the-boston-terrier-became-the-most-beloved-breed-in-massachusetts">most popular breeds</a>&nbsp;in the US.</p>\n<p>It still ranks as a popular pet in Boston, unsurprisingly.</p>\n<h2>7. A French Imposter?</h2>\n<p>Because of their similar physical appearance, Boston Terriers can be mistaken for another dog. The French Bulldog has a lot in common with the Boston Terrier.</p>\n<p>This is unsurprising when you consider that the Boston Terrier is half a Bulldog by its heritage.</p>\n<p>A great way of telling the two breeds apart is to check its coat. Only the Boston Terrier has that distinct coat which looks like a tuxedo.</p>\n<p>This should prevent any cases of mistaken identity from taking place!</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Give-Me-A-Five-Friendship-256041037.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-534" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Give-Me-A-Five-Friendship-256041037.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="601"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>8. Infamous Snoring Dogs</h2>\n<p>Any list of facts about Boston Terriers would not be complete without a mention of their most infamous habit - their snoring.</p>\n<p>This happens because of the distinctive shape of their muzzles. The result is that Boston Terriers inhale vast amounts of air with each breath they take.</p>\n<p>Any owner of a Boston Terrier can expect to get used to grunting, snoring, snorting, and even farting as a result. You have been warned...</p>\n<p>You should remember though that the snoring does not have any sort of ill effect on their health in the long term. However, you should always keep an eye out for other conditions which may affect your dog.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this list of common <a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-health/4-common-boston-terrier-health-issues-because-of-their-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Terrier health</a> issues as well as their <a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/blog/how-long-is-a-boston-terriers-lifespan-how-to-prolong-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life expectancy</a>.</p>\n<h2>9. A Pooche Fit for a President</h2>\n<p>US presidents are often known for their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9067587/theodore-roosevelt-safari">love of hunting</a>. However, this did not stop&nbsp;two Commanders-in-Chief from taking their Boston Terriers with them to the center of power.</p>\n<p>President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2015/08/26/how-the-boston-terrier-became-the-most-beloved-breed-in-massachusetts">Warren G. Harding</a>&nbsp;served as the 29th President between 1921 and 1923. He had a brown Boston Terrier called Hub. Unfortunately, this adorable piece of trivia has been overshadowed by the scandals associated with Harding.</p>\n<p>More recently, President Gerald Ford was the proud owner of two Boston Terriers during his time in office. Ford, the 38th President who acted as POTUS from 1974 to 1977, owned Fleck and Spot.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, neither man served out a full term as President. Perhaps they were too busy playing with their adorable dogs?</p>\n<h2>Fun-Filled Facts About Boston Terriers</h2>\n<p>As you can see from the list of facts above, there is a lot to love about the Boston Terrier. Far from being just a pretty dog, there is a century of heritage behind the Boston Terrier.</p>\n<p>Despite a violent history, the breed has won over millions of Americans to become one a beloved pet. They can truly now been some as one of man\'s best friends.</p>\n<p>Please continue checking our blog page for more information, advice, and fun facts about Boston Terriers.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->',

It\'s hard not to be!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you have your new soulmate, you want to give this pooch everything, including the best foods, treats, and toys.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as you can see, this breed has a smaller mouth than other dogs do, which means they may have some limitations when it comes to&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-food/feed-boston-terriers-food-guide/">things they can eat</a>&nbsp;and play with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this article, we\'ll let you know what to watch out for with Boston terriers and what the best dog toys are that you can buy for your new love!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":541,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Puppy-Play-42336853.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-Boston-Terrier-Puppy-Play-42336853.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-541"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>About Boston Terriers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This breed is a small one and typically has black and white coloring known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boston-terrier/">"tuxedo" coat</a>. Other colors for its coat include brindle and dark brown. It has a distinctive "bat ear" look, with large, pointed ears.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because they\'re a small breed, Boston terriers are great for people who live in smaller spaces. They\'re very loyal and affectionate and are always up for a walk at the park. They also have very noticeable personalities, which means you\'ll always be amused by their antics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>How Energetic&nbsp;Are Boston Terriers?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These dogs may be small, but they\'ll give you a run for your money! In these small pooches, you can find a huge package of energy and playfulness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, they can shoot straight off into the distance if they\'re not trained right, so be careful when you let them off their leashes when outside; they may zoom off right into traffic or a bigger, more aggressive dog, and you don\'t want that. Always be mindful of where your dog is. Keep your door closed at all times when indoors and always have a leash on it when you\'re out for a walk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don\'t give your Boston terrier enough exercise, he can start to pester you around the household. So make sure you take him out for plenty of walks and play time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Dog Rope Toys</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dog rope toys are great for any dog breed since they instinctively want to have tug of war fights. Hand your dog any item, and you can bet they\'ll want to spend a few minutes wrestling back and forth with you over it, even if they don\'t really want it!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dog rope toys are sturdily made with knots throughout so your puppy can get a better grip on it. Since the rope can be thick, but not so thick that your dog can\'t bite it, this is a very durable toy to have around the house.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An added bonus of dog rope toys is that its cylindrical shape makes it easy to pick up for Boston terriers, despite their smaller mouths.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Dog Ball Launchers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember how we said Boston terriers are a high energy breed? Well, you can help them burn some of that energy off with a&nbsp;dog ball launcher.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These toys require very little effort on your part! All you have to do is put the ball in the launcher, cock it behind your head, and let it fly. Your little puppy will go absolutely mad over it!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once it\'s chased after the ball and retrieved it, you only have to put it back into the launcher to repeat the process. You can do this over and over again until your pooch tires itself out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The great thing about dog ball launchers is that you can find ones with different sized balls. Just shop around and you\'re bound to find one with balls that can accommodate your dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":542,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-a-cute-dog-playing-at-a-public-205820218.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bigstock-a-cute-dog-playing-at-a-public-205820218.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-542"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>3.&nbsp;Frisbees</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Frisbees are another toy that requires very little effort on your part. Boston Terriers love to fetch, so bring your dog out on a sunny day to toss the frisbee around on the lawn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since frisbees are flat, your puppy won\'t have to open its mouth much to catch it while in air. You won\'t have to worry about it struggling to play fetch with you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you only play with your dog outdoors when the temperatures are moderate; as a brachycephalic dog that also has a short coat, Boston Terriers are susceptible to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bostonterrierforums.com/health-diet/safeguarding-your-boston-terrier-extreme-heat-and-cold">extreme heat and cold</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Rawhide Chews</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This isn\'t technically a toy, but it can still be something that keeps your dog preoccupied and happy. Rawhide chews are made from either cow or horse hides, and some contain flavorings, such as liver, chicken, or beef.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since all dogs have a natural instinct to chew on things, you don\'t want them to be targeting your nice furniture. Rawhide chews are great for providing them with a healthy alternative.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not only can chewing on rawhide chews keep your dog\'s jaws strong and their teeth clean, but it can also alleviate any emotional issues, such as anxiety.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Dog Treat Toys</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These can be especially fun for your puppy to play with. They\'re usually made out of rubbery substances, which makes them very pleasant to chew on for your dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because dog treat toys feel rubbery, this means you can bounce them on the floor so your Boston terrier can chase after them. Once they\'ve captured the toy, they get to enjoy a nice treat! You can stuff kibble or other dog treats inside these toys to give them an incentive to run after them when you\'ve tossed one on the floor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Get the Best Dog Toys for Your Boston Terrier</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see, even though your puppy may have a small mouth, there are plenty of toy choices available to give it hours of entertainment. From frisbees to rawhide chews, there\'s something bound to suit your Boston terrier, even if it\'s picky. So get out there and purchase the best dog toys to spoil your pup!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Need some training tips for your furry friend?

Read the best ways to handle Boston Terrier shedding problems here.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bigstock-Dog-Breed-Boston-Terrier-Pushe-310932424.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-558" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bigstock-Dog-Breed-Boston-Terrier-Pushe-310932424.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>1. Fix Their Diet</h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to manage Boston Terrier shedding is to manage their diet. You would be surprised how much the food they eat can impact how much their fur sheds.</p>\n<p>To make sure that they shed as little as possible their diet should be filled with protein and have an abundance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. These acids keep their skin healthy, like how eating certain foods can help your hair and skin.</p>\n<p>In addition to making sure that they have all the nutrients, you should also make sure that their diet is consistent. You shouldn\'t change it from day to day.</p>\n<p>If your dog isn\'t getting enough nutrients from their food, then you can always get supplements to feed them as well. This ensures that they are still happy and healthy.</p>\n<p>You should also make sure that they have plenty of clean water available so that they can stay hydrated during the day as well. Staying hydrated will also help control their shedding.</p>\n<h2>2. Brush and Bathe Them</h2>\n<p>It\'s incredibly important to brush your dog\'s hair every day. This will help remove hair that is about to fall off before it gets all over your living room or on your new couch.</p>\n<p>Not only will it keep them from shedding a lot, but it will also be a good bonding opportunity for you and your furry friend. The brushing session shouldn\'t take longer than five minutes, so it\'s an easy thing to incorporate into your daily schedule.</p>\n<p>To make sure that you are getting the most out of brushing your dog, you should make sure that you have chosen a good brush. Most owners recommend using a brush that has rubber bristles. The hair will stick to the rubber making sure that you get it all before it falls off your pet as they wander around your home.</p>\n<p>In addition to brushing them, you should also give them baths. Dogs can get into all kinds of things, so they probably need a bath anyway.</p>\n<p>But by doing this every week or every other week, you are loosening up some of the extra fur so that it falls out during the bath.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bigstock-Emotions-fear-Fright-Surpris-285942826.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-560" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bigstock-Emotions-fear-Fright-Surpris-285942826.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>3. Understand Hair Cycles</h2>\n<p>You may not realize it, but your hair goes through cycles which is why you\'re not too concerned when some of your hair falls out.</p>\n<p>Well, your Boston Terrier\'s coat goes through some of the same cycles.</p>\n<p>The first phase is known as anagen. This is the phase where the hair first starts initially growing.</p>\n<p>The second phase is known as catagen. This is the phase where the hair starts to shed and fall out. This happens after the hair has grown to the length that is standard for the dog breed, thanks to genetics.</p>\n<p>Telogen is the final phase where the hair isn\'t growing at all. However, this stage doesn\'t occur as frequently as the other two. Most of the time your dog\'s hair is growing, which means that it is shedding.</p>\n<p>Understanding these cycles helps you realize that your dog\'s shedding is going to fluctuate. There may be periods of time where they don\'t shed as much and times where they shed even more.</p>\n<p>Other factors can contribute to this as well. For example, it can be determined by how much sunlight they get. It can also change with the weather. Pet owners have said that during springtime, their dog\'s shedding becomes an even bigger problem.</p>\n<p>These cycles can also change if your pet is sick. It will also change as they get older, so try not to be upset with them because they can\'t control it.</p>\n<p>If you still think&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/blog/what-to-know-about-boston-terriers/">your Boston Terrier</a>&nbsp;is losing too much hair than is normal, or if their coat doesn\'t look as healthy, you should take them to go see their veterinarian.</p>\n<figure><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bigstock-Give-Me-A-Five-Friendship-256041037-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-559" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bigstock-Give-Me-A-Five-Friendship-256041037-1.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="601"></a></figure><p></p>\n<h2>4. See a Professional Groomer</h2>\n<p>Before you take a trip to the vet, you may want to stop in to see a professional groomer.</p>\n<p>Brushing your pet every day is important, but so is getting their haircut. These people are trained to know how to make your pet look adorable, so it may be best to leave the styling to them.</p>\n<p>Your pet should be groomed every month or so which also helps with shedding. All their pet hair will be left at the salon where you don\'t have to worry about it.</p>\n<p>A professional groomer can also give your Boston Terrier a bath if you\'re not up for the challenge.</p>\n<h2>5. Use Air Filters</h2>\n<p>You\'ll never be able to stop your pet from getting at least a little bit of hair around the house, so you may have to do some clean up on your own.</p>\n<p>Getting a good air filter can help reduce allergies. When your dog sheds, the dander that\'s in them spread into the air, which you then breathe in.</p>\n<p>However, if you are using an air filter, the dander will get circulated into that so that you\'re not breathing it into your lungs every day. You can install them through your air conditioning and heating system, but you can also buy standalone filters.</p>\n<p>Once you install the air filter, you should also remember to change it every month or two to make sure that it is still filtering the air you\'re breathing.</p>\n<h2>6. Vacuum</h2>\n<p>An air filter won\'t be able to clean up everything, so you will need to make sure that you have a good vacuum.</p>\n<p>There are all kinds of different vacuums to help you clean up your pet\'s hair, so just make sure you&nbsp;<a href="https://primereviews.org/best-pet-hair-vacuum-cleaners/">do your research</a>&nbsp;before you buy one.</p>\n<h2>Minimize Boston Terrier Shedding Today</h2>\n<p>It can be annoying when your Boston Terrier shedding takes over your home.</p>\n<p>However, having this loving pet can make up for all that.</p>\n<p>If you love your Boston Terrier, figure out what the best toys to buy them are and&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-toys-clothes/buying-for-boston-terriers-5-of-the-best-dog-toys-for-the-breed/">give them a little treat</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->',

And to share their foul odor with everyone around them. <strong>The \'American Gentleman” isn\'t no gentleman in this area.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Due to their short snouts, Bostons tend to swallow a lot of air, especially when eating,&nbsp; which results in the air coming from the other end and can definitely clear out a room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center"} -->\n<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Below we will provide 5 tips in regards to this gassy problem of the Boston Terrier breed.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Be mindful of what you feed your furry friend.</strong> Your Boston Terriers\' flatulence is caused by their sensitive stomach and any allergic reaction can instantly result in the extra gas. Corn, soy, and grains are in most dry dog foods and can be a big reason for your dog\'s gas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Play around with different meal preps instead, watch your pet\'s reactions to their food tolerance to find the one that works best with them.</strong> Try to refrain from giving your pet some table scraps as well. As much as we love our furry friends, spoiling them with the wrong food can be unpleasant for them (and you!).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>It\'s important that you speak to your Vet about your Boston Terriers flatulence and your Boston Terriers gas. Don\'t just write it off as the breed.</strong> <strong>You want to be sure there are no underlying health issues or concerns before you chalk it up to “just gas”.</strong> There can be a number of reasons for gas, including allergy,&nbsp; GI disorders, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Intestinal parasites, and Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Just like humans, diet is an important key, but here are some other ways to try and decrease the air your dog is swallowing when eating.</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":621,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-freestocksorg-688961-1.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-freestocksorg-688961-1.jpg" alt="Hungry Boston Terrier looking at their dog food longingly" class="wp-image-621"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3><strong>First, try and feed your dog in a quiet area</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Separate pets at feeding time and feed your dog in smaller amounts more frequently, and make sure they get enough exercise.

Make sure that it\'s not in the direct path of the afternoon sun and where their fitful sleep cannot be easily disturbed.</strong> Of course, most of them will be in the living room but it\'s helpful to train them to identify boundaries! This could also give them a sense of security as they are entrusted with space specifically for their use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Play calming music for your dog or turn on the television</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>According to a <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ufaw/aw/2002/00000011/00000004/art00002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2002 scientific study</a> by Dr. Deborah Wells who is an animal behaviorist, classical music with a tempo of 50-60 beats per minute induces a state of calm for dogs.</strong> Dogs\' auditory senses are highly sensitive and while this may be a double-edged sword, creating the right ambiance for their space is great for their overall disposition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\'s important to note though that not all kinds of music should be in their playlist! Choppy and loud music can agitate them and can only increase their anxiety levels.

ASMR channels that are intended for sleep or instrumental lullabies will definitely be perfect for this. Another thing you can do as well is turn on the TV and switch it to animal channels</strong>!

Here\'s a checklist that could help you in order to gauge if they need a vet\'s evaluation as soon as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":691,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CHECKLIST.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CHECKLIST.png" alt="3 checklist: Do they often gag or their mouths froth suddenly without any prior reason?

This is a biological process that maintains the body temperature of any living thing for survival. Now because small dogs are more often than no have little insulation because of their size, they are prone to have imbalances in their homeostasis.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>You have to make sure that you won\'t transport your dog from an extremely cold temperature to any area (like the park or just generally outside) with excessive heat. If this happens frequently this will shock their bodies and could be fatal for them.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To avoid this health issue from becoming a major danger to your Boston Terrier, make sure to hydrate them frequently and if can be, regulate their environment\'s temperature.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Patellar Luxation</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The patella (kneecap) is often displaced in small dogs because of their bodily proportions. According to the American College of Veterinary Surgeons (ACVS), this is often <strong>caused by a traumatic injury to the knee or other skeletal abnormalities</strong>. Patellar luxation is one of the most common orthopedic conditions in dogs and affects most terrier breeds and other small dogs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When this happens, your dog will probably<strong> experience limping and have trouble putting weight on their legs. Alongside this, other symptoms might be them walking with a straight unbendable leg.</strong> Most of the time if this occurs, a surgery is the common treatment and will avoid this health issue from recurring.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that you have to make sure that your <a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-food/feed-boston-terriers-food-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Terrier\'s diet</a> is well balanced! These dogs are prone to obesity and this will also lead to patellar luxation later on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":621,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-freestocksorg-688961-1.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-freestocksorg-688961-1.jpg" alt="Hungry Boston Terrier looking at their dog food longingly" class="wp-image-621"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Ectropion</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last but not the least is ectropion which is very common for flat-faced dogs with short muzzles.<strong> This is an eye condition that makes their eyelids turn outward leaving their inner eyelid surface easily irritated because of exposure.</strong> Because of their cute and bulgy eyes, Boston Terriers are easily affected by this condition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Generally, this condition can be easily treated with ophthalmic antibiotics and ointments to prevent their cornea and conjunctiva from drying out. Surgical measures can also be done if their ectropion is getting severe as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>While Boston Terriers may acquire a lot of health issues along the way this does not necessarily mean that they will experience all of this in their lifetime. The important takeaway from this is that they should have a well-balanced lifestyle to avoid any of these complications in the near future. After all, it would only be beneficial if you are knowledgeable about these in the first place for prevention.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

The AKC acknowledges the black and white coat of the Boston Terrier but not the other variations. However, these coats are still acceptable if you intend them as family pets instead of show pets. Their coat as well should be short and smooth.</li><li><strong>Skull Structure&nbsp;</strong>- their skull structure should also be a little bit squared with a little flatness on the top.</li><li><strong>Muzzle &amp; Nose </strong>- their&nbsp;&nbsp;muzzle should be short and their nose should be black as well and this is attributed by their "flat face" inherited from their parent breeds which are the English bulldog and the now extinct White English Terrier.</li><li><strong>Ears&nbsp;</strong>- their ears on the otherhand can be floppy in the first stages but as they grow up their ears also naturally perk up until they are upright. In fact this is one characteristic that sets them apart from other mixed breeds that share a lot of features with them. The Frenchton and Bugg are one of the mixed breeds that are often mistaken as purebreed Boston Terriers</li><li><strong>Musculature&nbsp;</strong>- the muscle structure of Boston Terriers should be compact and sturdy and you can look over their legs and determine their athleticism.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":584,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/oskar-kadaksoo-ClnF909Xrvc-unsplash-1.jpg"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/oskar-kadaksoo-ClnF909Xrvc-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="Boston Terrier In An Outdoor Park with Trees on the background" class="wp-image-584"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Boston Terriers are playful and affectionate dogs but before you finally decide to buy one you should be able to do a lot of research beforehand.

    blockContent: '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>It\'s a well-known fact that Boston Terriers have always been best friends with Pugs. Actually, Boston Terriers just seem overly friendly to every dog or human!</strong> Pugs like Boston Terriers are sturdy compact dogs that have a noticeable wrinkled muzzle. They are prone to easily gain weight which is why when you overfeed them with the love they just look so fluffy and bloated. <strong>It should be noted though that obesity in dogs can also give way to other major health issues. Now a lot of people find both these dogs adorable that some breeders decided for them to mix. Thus the Boston Terrier and Pug mix is born.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center"} -->\n<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Discover what this Boston Terrier and Pug mix is and if they can just be the right fit for you!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":874,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BOSTON-TERRIER-PUG-MIX.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BOSTON-TERRIER-PUG-MIX.png" alt="boston terrier pug mix dog with bokeh background" class="wp-image-874"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Bugg or Pugin (you could call them which ever way you want, they\'re still cute) is a <a href="https://www.dogbreedinfo.com/designerdogs.htm#:~:text=Designer%20dog%3F%3F&amp;text=A%20%22designer%22%20dog%20(as,and%20characteristics%20as%20the%20others." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer dog</a>&nbsp;and they have inherited one of the best temperament from their parents.</strong> Boston Terriers and Pugs by nature are quite similar when it comes to play and their attachment to their owners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is why <strong>Buggs are also intelligent, spunky, and extremely friendly</strong>. If you have kids at home, Buggs won\'t be aggressive over them and can even tolerate long hours of play with them. Though they will sometimes be a little stubborn and not in the mood to play, they won\'t usually lash out to your children\'s constant nagging on them!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This Boston Terrier mix is also highly affectionate.<strong> It\'s no surprise that they won\'t really like to be left alone at home since both Boston Terriers and Pugs are quite clingy!</strong> Expect that whenever you\'re at home, they will constantly follow you just to get some affection in between.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The physical characteristics of a Bugg isn\'t that hard to imagine especially that both of the parents have a lot of similar facial features</strong>. The only difference usually is brought by the distribution of the coat and the ears.

However, when it comes to breeding them, there might be some anomalies. If you like to have a cuter version of a Boston Terrier, the best way is by getting a mixed breed with a smaller parent. The other way that is quite questionable is by introducing the dwarfism gene on them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Introducing The Dwarfism Gene</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This will usually result in creating stunted growth for them and their bones won\'t grow to their regular size.

Not to mention that Boston Terriers by nature can acquire patellar luxation. which is a bone condition that can make chances of bone dislocation possible due to their weight. Another result from this type is that their jaws and bone structure in the head will be underdeveloped as well and can create more respiratory problems for them especially in their flat-face condition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pituitary+dwarfism+dogs&amp;oq=Pituitary+Dwarfism+dogs&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.1701j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong>Pituitary Dwarfism</strong></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This type on the other hand is caused when the pituitary gland does not secrete enough hormones causing disproportionate growth.

They are well-balanced and the colors they sport should only be brindle, seal, or black with white markings. They have a short dog coat and the <a href="https://snty.wpengine.com/blog/boston-terrier-tail-guide-do-they-have-it-or-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Terrier\'s tail</a> should be short.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Their head is also in proportion to their body and is often characterized to have this flat shape at the top. The "color and white markings" are by far the most distinctive characteristic that the AKC monitor when it comes to Boston Terriers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nExpression</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ideal expression that most Boston Terriers are known for is their alertness but also kindness exhibited by their large imploring eyes. This indicates their high intelligence and they often have an impression of strength and gracefulness. This is quite an apt picture coupled with their nickname as the American Gentleman.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nHead (Muzzle, Jaw, Bite, Skull &amp; Stop)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Boston Terrier\'s head is another distinctive trait for them. Their head skull structure should be flat in their head and free from wrinkles with flat cheeks and well defined brow line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to their muzzle, it should be square and shorter in length than in width. It should also be proportional to the skull and does not exceed one-third of its length.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers also should have broad and square jaws and have an even bite with their teeth when their mouth is closed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nEyes</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to their eyes, they are large and wide apart. In fact, this is one of the most appealing feature of Boston Terriers! The eyes should be set square in the skull and other colors that have any traces of blue will be disqualified.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nEars</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terrier\'s ears should be erect, small, and should be situated near the corners of the skull as possible. French bulldogs are often mistaken for Boston Terriers but the main difference between the two is their ears!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nNeck, Topline, Body &amp; Tail</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The neck should be proportional to the skull and not overly long or too small to support the head. Since the body of Boston Terriers should appear short&nbsp;The topline is level and the rump curves slightly to the set-on of the tail. Their tails should be short and are often 1&nbsp; - 2 inches long as they are part of the bobtail breed. Dogs that have docked tails are disqualified as well as it isn\'t a natural process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nForequarters</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terrier\'s forequarters should be laid back and straight in bone. Their feet are also characterized to be small, round, and compact. Those that have splayed feet or legs that are lacking in substance are automatically disqualified.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nHindquarters</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hindquarters of this breed should be well muscled and sturdy. The stifles should also be bent and their thighs are characterized to be strong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nColor, Coat &amp; Markings</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The color, coat, and markings is by far the most prominent way to identify if a Boston Terrier passed the AKC Standards. There are only three colors accepted and these are brindle, seal, and black. The required markings of Boston Terriers should be white in the muzzle band, between the eyes, and their chest. However, these markings can still vary and accepted as long as it is near those locations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">\nTemperament</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers are by nature sociable and energetic. They are very loyal to their owners and often experience loneliness when left to their own!

Not only will you get a highly intelligent and active breed but a highly sociable and loving one!</strong> If you\'re contemplating on getting a Bossi Poo as a new member of your family, we\'re gonna give you the facts on this wonderful breed!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center"} -->\n<h2 class="has-text-align-center">The Bossi Poo Guide: Boston Terrier Poodle Mix</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1.png" alt="Boston Terrier puppy lying down" width="900" height="600"></a></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Boston Terrier and Poodle mix is quite a new crossbreed so their origins are not in detail.</strong> However, they probably have been bred when <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/designer-dog-breeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer dogs</a> started popping up in the late 20th century. A lot is not known from this dog breed because it\'s relatively new. Their appearance and temperament usually varies and aren\'t really standardized. However, one thing\'s for sure, the Bossi Poo is an adorable dog that you will still surely love.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Breed Size, Life Span, &amp; Maintenance</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers are small to medium size by nature while Poodles have three categories of size. The standard size is more than 15 inches tall at the shoulder; Miniature Poodles are 15 inches flat or under; and Toy Poodles are usually no more than 10 inches. <strong>The Bossi Poo in this case is 15 inches by height and have an approximate weight of 25-50 pounds. They also live up to 12 or 15 years which is pretty long already!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This breed doesn\'t really need a lot of maintenance as well because of its short dog coat. <strong>While Poodles have naturally curly hair, they are usually tight and stiff and the Bossi Poo in turn acquired this and most of the time have a hypoallergenic coat because of this.</strong> Their coat is also resistant to any climate but make sure to only keep them in places with moderate temperatures so they won\'t be susceptible to sudden illnesses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>They don\'t usually shed a lot so you\'ll have little to no worries on cleaning up their furry mess! Their maintenance is low to moderate so you can save up a lot in their daily food intake.</strong> If they have a dog coat like that of their Poodle parent, you\'ll have to trim them every few months but so far, it wouldn\'t really be much of a hassle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969" src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1.png" alt="Poodle puppy smiling" width="900" height="600"></a></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Temperament</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Bossi Poo is a very affectionate furball! You\'ll definitely enjoy their company and they can be a little too persistent on vying for your attention!</strong> Like the Boston Terrier\'s temperament, they are pretty playful and energetic. This mixed breed just loves the company so if you have a large family in your home, they will surely love the various attention showered upon them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>They are pretty good with kids and are tolerant with their shenanigans as well which is why they are great family dogs.</strong> Bossi Poos can also experience some separation anxiety and will always look for you when left on their own. While they can usually be independent when trained, they will mostly want people around them to interact with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Bossi Poos are also quite intelligent and easy to train so if you\'re a first-time dog owner, this breed will really be ideal for you.</strong> Just make sure to use firm but gentle techniques and they can easily follow them. The key here is to socialize them at an early age so they can handle long hours without you and can be alert.<strong> Speaking of alertness, this mixed breed won\'t be a huge barker just like their Boston Terrier parent but they will definitely bark in the right timing!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"center","level":3} -->\n<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Health Conditions</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Crossbreeding had been popularized mostly because it helps in eliminating the health defects of one breed.</strong> The Boston Terrier Poodle mix, fortunately, doesn\'t have any major health issues thanks to their combination. <a href="https://snty.wpengine.com/category/boston-terrier-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Terrier health issues</a> are quite prominent though of course not all of it can appear in their life. However, when they are mixed with the Poodle breed, the chances of these fatal health conditions are little to none!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They are likely healthier than both its parents though they can experience mild problems as well. This can often be hip dysplasia, allergies, eye problems, or deafness.

Here\'s a<a href="https://snty.wpengine.com/blog/tips-before-buying-boston-terriers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> detailed guide</a> that you might want to read as well to gauge this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1006,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-3.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-3.png" alt="They don\'t provide medical healthcare for the Boston Terriers" class="wp-image-1006"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Major red flag here! You should keep in mind that a rescue shelter in the first place rescues dogs and give medical healthcare immediately. Some of the dogs in the shelter have just escaped euthanasia or undergoing complicated diseases. And in order to "save" them, the organization will have to bring the dogs to the vet for checkups and medication.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the shelter doesn\'t do so in the first place and will instead give that initial responsibility to you, then they are definitely not a rescue shelter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1007,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-3.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-3.png" alt="They avoid providing information on how they acquired the dogs" class="wp-image-1007"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->\n<p class="has-text-align-left">Each rescue animal has an origin, and most of the volunteers in a rescue shelter know intimately the details on where they have found these dogs. True rescue shelters dedicate their time to looking for stray pets that have been abused or left for dead in the streets. So it is definitely confusing if the rescue won\'t provide information on where they got the Boston Terriers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More often than not, these people might withhold this information because they have been acquiring the dogs in illegal ways like puppy mills. Puppy mills are inhumane places that continue breeding dogs in ill conditions for the sake of quick cash. Some of these puppy mills might even be parading as a bonafide rescue shelter instead!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So like the first tip, you should always be wary once they don\'t let you see the shelter or withhold information regarding the acquisition process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1008,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1.png" alt="They overcharge with the adoption fees" class="wp-image-1008"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rescue shelters first and foremost are not formed in order to gain profit. This is why the organization is mostly composed of passionate advocates and volunteers. More often than not, the dogs there are cheaper than the regular price from other breeders. In fact, a lot of potential adopters acquire their Boston Terriers from rescue shelters because of this very reason.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now if they put exorbitant prices on their rescue dogs, then that\'s a major red flag to look out for. The success of a rescue shelter is not measured by their profit. Yes, the work they do is tiring, and are often not compensated, but that is in fact why they are made out of volunteers in the first place. True rescue shelters may ask for donations for the upkeep of their dogs, but monetization isn\'t their end goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1009,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-1.png" alt="They don\'t give you a medical care kit or simply not aware of the health issues of Boston Terriers" class="wp-image-1009"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers have a lot of possible conditions and it\'s only important that you, the adopter, and the rescue shelter are well aware of this. If the organization don\'t have any clue of the regular Boston Terrier health issues then it probably means that they also didn\'t apply any healthcare for the dogs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They should also be able to provide you a detailed care kit that explains the various health issues Boston Terriers may experience as well as their training. How much food they should eat, what kind of ideal environment for play they should have, and all the other details for their care.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1010,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-1.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-1.png" alt=" They seem to have a constant stream of purebred or designer Boston Terriers" class="wp-image-1010"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last but not the least, if the rescue shelter seems to have a steady flow of purebred Boston Terriers, then that\'s a telltale sign that they\'re operating a puppy mill or acquiring the Boston Terriers from one. With this kind of operation, they can easily sell the dogs constantly and without fail. This further emphasizes that their priority is driving sales to their rescue shelter aka business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rescue shelters have a great cause for animal welfare. However, you should always be extra careful when doing transactions because you might just happen to acquire from insincere organizations. Adopting a Boston Terrier is indeed a great endeavor, you are not only "saving" them but also give them all the love and support they haven\'t experienced in their previous family. We definitely don\'t deserve dogs but they do deserve love from us.

This is a great way for them to be more exposed to other dogs and people as well.</strong> This is also beneficial to you if you\'re a first-time dog owner. The bottom line here is that you have to support them all throughout the socialization process and make sure to not overwhelm them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Always take baby steps out of their comfort zone, and celebrate their small wins to make them feel happy and secure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1033} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-4.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1033"/></a><figcaption>Familiarize yourself with their routine and needs</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers don\'t need a lot of maintenance and this is in fact one of their advantages.<strong> They don\'t shed a lot as opposed to other terrier breeds and you can just give them low to medium maintenance for their grooming.</strong> Alongside this, they also don\'t require a lot of food. Give them only 1 1/2 cups of high-quality dog food every day and night, and you\'re good to go!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Despite their small size, Boston terriers tend to be lively and energetic, requiring an energy dose to keep up with their agility.</strong> While Boston Terrier puppies require a larger calorie intake to foster their growing needs, the calorie count for adult Boston terriers largely depends on their activity level. Here\'s a <a href="https://snty.wpengine.com/boston-terrier-food/feed-boston-terriers-food-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Terrier food guide</a> that you might want to look at for reference if you don\'t know where to start.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The trick here is, you just don\'t have to overdo any of it. Don\'t overfeed them because they are prone to obesity that may lead to patellar luxation and can also cause gassy problems. Don\'t let them overexert their energy because they can also overheat and will create other health issues for them.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers are generally low maintenance but pretty high maintenance when it comes to their emotional needs!<strong> So while you can be pretty lax about their routine, you always have to give them the validation and love they need.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1034} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1034"/></a><figcaption>Training them with the utmost care and discipline</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Training Boston Terriers may be a chore for some but definitely rewarding in the end.

However, they can be easily hurt as well if you keep on scolding them.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\'s also important that you can set boundaries in your house to properly train them. Let your Boston Terrier out frequently for their bathroom needs and praise them every time they achieve it. If they might do something undesirable, give them a firm "no" rather than shouting at them or hitting them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Positive reinforcement is the key to training them but you also don\'t have to overdo it!</strong> It might be pretty hard at first but always train them firmly and with the right dose of affection.

FIX THEIR DIET</span></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the best ways to manage Boston Terrier shedding is to manage their diet. You would be surprised how much the food they eat can impact how much their fur sheds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make sure that they shed as little as possible their diet should be filled with protein and have an abundance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. These acids keep their skin healthy, like how eating certain foods can help your hair and skin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to making sure that they have all the nutrients, you should also make sure that their diet is consistent. You shouldn’t change it from day to day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your dog isn’t getting enough nutrients from their food, then you can always get supplements to feed them as well. This ensures that they are still happy and healthy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should also make sure that they have plenty of clean water available so that they can stay hydrated during the day as well. Staying hydrated will also help control their shedding.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. BRUSH AND BATHE THEM</span></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s incredibly important to brush your dog’s hair every day. This will help remove hair that is about to fall off before it gets all over your living room or on your new couch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not only will it keep them from shedding a lot, but it will also be a good bonding opportunity for you and your furry friend. The brushing session shouldn’t take longer than five minutes, so it’s an easy thing to incorporate into your daily schedule.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1065,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4.png" alt="closeup shot of Boston Terrier" class="wp-image-1065"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make sure that you are getting the most out of brushing your dog, you should make sure that you have chosen a good brush. Most owners recommend using a brush that has rubber bristles. The hair will stick to the rubber making sure that you get it all before it falls off your pet as they wander around your home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to brushing them, you should also give them baths. Dogs can get into all kinds of things, so they probably need a bath anyway.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But by doing this every week or every other week, you are loosening up some of the extra fur so that it falls out during the bath.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. UNDERSTAND HAIR CYCLES</strong></span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You may not realize it, but your hair goes through cycles which is why you’re not too concerned when some of your hair falls out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, your Boston Terrier’s coat goes through some of the same cycles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first phase is known as anagen. This is the phase where the hair first starts initially growing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second phase is known as catagen. This is the phase where the hair starts to shed and fall out. This happens after the hair has grown to the length that is standard for the dog breed, thanks to genetics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Telogen is the final phase where the hair isn’t growing at all. However, this stage doesn’t occur as frequently as the other two. Most of the time your dog’s hair is growing, which means that it is shedding.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding these cycles helps you realize that your dog’s shedding is going to fluctuate. There may be periods of time where they don’t shed as much and times where they shed even more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1066,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5.png" alt="side profile of Boston Terrier" class="wp-image-1066"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other factors can contribute to this as well. For example, it can be determined by how much sunlight they get. It can also change with the weather. Pet owners have said that during springtime, their dog’s shedding becomes an even bigger problem.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These cycles can also change if your pet is sick. It will also change as they get older, so try not to be upset with them because they can’t control it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you still think&nbsp;<a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/blog/what-to-know-about-boston-terriers/">your Boston Terrier</a>&nbsp;is losing too much hair than is normal, or if their coat doesn’t look as healthy, you should take them to go see their veterinarian.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. SEE A PROFESSIONAL GROOMER</strong></span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before you take a trip to the vet, you may want to stop in to see a professional groomer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brushing your pet every day is important, but so is getting their haircut. These people are trained to know how to make your pet look adorable, so it may be best to leave the styling to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your pet should be groomed every month or so which also helps with shedding. All their pet hair will be left at the salon where you don’t have to worry about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A professional groomer can also give your Boston Terrier a bath if you’re not up for the challenge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. USE AIR FILTERS</strong></span></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’ll never be able to stop your pet from getting at least a little bit of hair around the house, so you may have to do some clean up on your own.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting a good air filter can help reduce allergies. When your dog sheds, the dander that’s in them spread into the air, which you then breathe in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, if you are using an air filter, the dander will get circulated into that so that you’re not breathing it into your lungs every day. You can install them through your air conditioning and heating system, but you can also buy standalone filters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you install the air filter, you should also remember to change it every month or two to make sure that it is still filtering the air you’re breathing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. VACUUM</span></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An air filter won’t be able to clean up everything, so you will need to make sure that you have a good vacuum.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are all kinds of different vacuums to help you clean up your pet’s hair, so just make sure you&nbsp;<a href="https://primereviews.org/best-pet-hair-vacuum-cleaners/">do your research</a>&nbsp;before you buy one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1064,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-2.png"><img src="http://snty.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-2.png" alt="Boston Terrier with a girl" class="wp-image-1064"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boston Terriers are generally lively and playful dogs to be with.

Lilac Bostons are a combination of black dilute and brown, and their iris is a bright blue color.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>BLACK BOSTON TERRIER- </strong>Seal is usually a color that is used to specifically describe Boston Terriers, and it’s even often mistaken for the black and white-colored ones.

This will lead your dog to create snorting sounds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Hypoplastic trachea</strong>- this may put your pet at risk during anesthesia because this means narrowed windpipe.
